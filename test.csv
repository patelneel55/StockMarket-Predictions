The Credit Agreement amended and restated the $2.25 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement dated as of August 5, 2014 among 3M, the lenders named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent.   Under the Credit Agreement, 3M pays a facility fee that varies between 0.040% and 0.100%, depending on our credit rating.  Revolving advances denominated in U.S. Dollars carry, at 3M’s option, either the “base rate” of interest in effect plus the applicable margin, or the “eurocurrency rate” which is a periodic fixed LIBOR plus the applicable margin.  Borrowings denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars carry the “eurocurrency rate.” The “base rate” of interest is the highest of (i) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% (if one-month LIBOR is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero).  The applicable margin includes a market rate spread which is a rate per annum equal to the credit default swap mid-rate spread of 3M for the applicable tenor.  This spread varies between 0.100% and 1.125% depending on our credit rating.  The applicable margin for “eurocurrency rate” advances is the market rate spread.  The applicable margin for “base rate” advances is the market rate spread minus 1.00% (but not less than 0%).   The Credit Agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of the total facility up to $5.0 billion, with the grant of such request at the lenders’ discretion.  The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where 3M is not the surviving entity. Further, the Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring us to maintain our EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to interest payable on all funded debt for the same period.   The full terms and conditions of the credit facility are set forth in the Credit Agreement. A copy of the Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

The Proposed Rule, published in April and disclosed by the Company on a Form 8-K filed on April 17, 2017, included changes for all MS-DRGs and proposed a reduction of 34.8% versus prior year for MS-DRG 215. After further analysis, CMS updated the Proposed Rule and published the Final IPPS Rule implementing a smaller reduction of 19.1% versus prior year for MS-DRG 215. The final rule will be effective for the 12 months following October 1, 2017 for all discharges.  Hospital reimbursement for Calendar Year 2017, Abiomed Fiscal Year 2018  Abiomed’s Impella technology is most commonly reimbursed under four MS-DRG categories including: 1) assistance in the catheterization lab only in MS-DRGs 216-221; 2) implant, assistance and removal after leaving the catheterization lab in MS-DRG 215; 3) right and left side heart support known as bi-ventricular and removal in MS-DRG 1-2, and; 4) hospitals receiving transferred patients with removal of the device in MS-DRG 268-269. In prior years, Impella was primarily reimbursed in only one category of MS-DRGs 216-221. The American Hospital Association (AHA) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have facilitated a system of care around the utilization of percutaneous heart pumps for the catheterization lab, ICU support, and transfer of patients to specialized centers. This progress also reflects the expansion of Impella FDA indications for High Risk PCI, AMI Cardiogenic Shock, and bi-ventricular support.  Table A.

The final rulemaking may differ substantially from this proposal. The text of the Proposed Rule did not discuss any specific information relating to payment, coding or MS-DRG assignments for Impella, percutaneous heart assist, or related technology. Data tables also released with the Proposed Rule include changes for all MS-DRGs which included a proposed reduction for MS-DRG 215 of 34.8%. The remaining MS-DRG categories have proposed changes ranging from -7% to +3.5%. All current MS-DRG rates will remain in place until October 2017. Table B. Summary of common MS-DRGs from the Proposed Rule for illustration only.        Examples provided with Major Comorbidity or MCC.  ‘All Hospitals’ include 3,405 medicare hospitals, and only approximately 1,400 have cath labs or operating rooms. Sample includes 100 Impella sites.  A new formula for calculating all Medicare MS-DRG base weights, the calculation used to determine hospital payment level, was described in the Proposed Rule. However, no Impella patient claim data related to the change in the October 2016 American Hospital Association (AHA) Coding Clinic publication was included in the analysis for the proposed MS-DRG rate changes. Abiomed is reviewing the detailed data within the tables and will be discussing the appropriate DRG rates with CMS during the open comment period to confirm it accurately reflects the hospital resources required to treat these very ill patients.

If achieved, the RSUs will be eligible to performance vest based at the end of a three-year performance period that began on June 15, 2015 and ends on June 15, 2018 as follows:           If the TSR Percentile Rank falls between two of the percentiles described above, the percentage of the RSUs that vest will be based on a straight-line interpolation between the two groupings.

114,AES,stay,2018-01-16 06:46:37,"December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. The legislation significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, introducing new limitations on interest expense, subjecting foreign earnings in excess of an allowable return to U.S. taxation, adopting a territorial tax regime and imposing a one-time transitional tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company estimates, based on currently available information that the enactment of the Tax Act will result in a non-cash charge of approximately $1.10-$1.25 in Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations in the fourth quarter of 2017.  The majority of this charge is due to the deemed repatriation tax. The remainder includes the effects of the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to lower enacted corporate tax rates. This charge has no impact on the Company’s previously provided non-GAAP Adjusted EPS guidance as the Company will revise the definition of its non-GAAP measures to exclude this item.The Company currently expects the Tax Act to have a non-cash impact on Adjusted EPS of $0.05-$0.08 in 2018, after $1 billion of debt pay down related to the sale of its Masinloc business in the Philippines, announced in December 2017.  The Company will provide an update on the prospective impacts of the Tax Act and additional mitigation measures on its fourth quarter 2017 financial review call in February 2018. The impact of the Tax Act may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act.The information set forth in this Item 8.01 is intended to be furnished under Item 8.01 of Form 8-K.

130,AES,down,2016-06-23 17:01:32,"June 23, 2016, The AES Corporation (the “Company”) addressed a June 20, 2016 ruling by the Supreme Court of Ohio.  On that date, the court issued an opinion in the appeal of the current electric security plan of The Dayton Power and Light Company (“DP&L”), the principal subsidiary of DPL Inc. (“DPL” and, together with DP&L, the “Subsidiaries”), which had been approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (“PUCO”) for the years 2014-2016 (the “ESP”) and which, among other matters, permitted DP&L to collect a non-bypassable service stability rider equal to approximately $9.2 million per month for each of those years.  In the attached opinion, the court stated briefly, without expanding upon the basis, that the PUCO’s approval of the ESP was reversed on the authority of one of the court’s prior rulings in a separate case not involving the Subsidiaries.    Under Supreme Court of Ohio rules, the court is expected to issue a mandate with respect to its ruling within 10 days of the date that the opinion was issued, which may provide clarity on the Subsidiaries’ options in response to the ruling.   If such options prove to be unavailable, the loss of the service stability rider is expected to have a material impact on the Company.  However, the Subsidiaries do not pay dividends to the Company and therefore, the loss of the service stability rider would not impact expectations for Parent Free Cash Flow. The Company’s 2016 guidance and 2017-18 expectations were provided on May 9, 2016 and are not being updated at this time.Additional information about DP&L’s February 22, 2016 filing with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio for a new electric security plan beginning January 1, 2017, is included in the Annual Report on 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

138,AES,stay,2015-12-01 17:30:02,"November 25, 2015, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of The AES Corporation (the “Company” or “AES”) adopted amendments to the By-Laws (the “By-Laws”) of the Company, effective November 25, 2015 to allow stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to provide for proxy access. At AES’ 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, a majority of stockholders voting supported: (a) a non-binding management proposal to allow stockholders to request that the Company call a special meeting of stockholders and (b) a non-binding stockholder proposal requesting that the Board provide for proxy access.   After AES’ 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company engaged in discussions regarding proxy access and special meetings with a number of its largest stockholders that together held over 40% of its outstanding stock. This allowed the Company to gain valuable feedback from its stockholders regarding special meetings and proxy access, including their input on particular parameters that AES’ stockholders view as appropriate for these types of bylaw provisions. Based on the voting results on the two proposals at the 2015 annual meeting and the feedback received from AES’ stockholders during the engagement process, the Board implemented terms for AES which it believes will provide meaningful special meeting and proxy access rights for stockholders while furthering the long-term interests of AES and its stockholders and limiting the potential for abuse.Sections 9.01 and 9.02 have been amended to provide that a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least three years may nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials directors constituting up to 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-Laws.  Section 2.04 has been amended to provide that stockholders who own at least 25% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock and satisfy other requirements may have the Company call a special meeting of stockholders.In connection with adopting these provisions, the Board also amended the By-Laws to conform the informational requirements for stockholders introducing nominations or proposing business at annual meetings or for action by written consent; to provide for plurality voting in the context of contested elections; and to make additional clarifying, conforming or technical amendments.This description of the amendments to the By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the By-Laws filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report.

This adjustment will also impact any U.S. GAAP or non-GAAP financial measures that use net earnings or total shareholders’ equity.While the Company believes that the foregoing estimates are reasonable, it is relying upon guidance provided by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 that provides a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date of December 22, 2017 in order to complete the accounting for the effects of Tax Reform. Therefore, in future periods the Company may reduce or increase the estimated reduction of net deferred tax liability or make other revisions relating to Tax Reform, and any such revision may be material.FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a “safe harbor” to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those informational statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements. The Company desires to take advantage of these provisions.

Aflac undertakes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements.The company cautions readers that the following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements: difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy; exposure to significant interest rate risk; concentration of business in Japan; foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate; failure to execute or implement the conversion of the Japan branch to a legal subsidiary; limited availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments; deviations in actual experience from pricing and reserving assumptions; ability to continue to develop and implement improvements in information technology systems; governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets; interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems; ongoing changes in the Company's industry; failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security; extensive regulation and changes in law or regulation by governmental authorities; tax rates applicable to the Company may change; defaults and credit downgrades of investments; ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates, brokers, employees, and distribution partners; decline in creditworthiness of other financial institutions; subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to Aflac Incorporated; decreases in the Company's financial strength or debt ratings; inherent limitations to risk management policies and procedures; concentration of the Company's investments in any particular single-issuer or sector; differing judgments applied to investment valuations; ability to effectively manage key executive succession; significant valuation judgments in determination of amount of impairments taken on the Company's investments; catastrophic events including, but not necessarily limited to, epidemics, pandemics, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, war or other military action, terrorism or other acts of violence, and damage incidental to such events; changes in U.S. and/or Japanese accounting standards; loss of consumer trust resulting from events external to the Company's operations; increased expenses and reduced profitability resulting from changes in assumptions for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; level and outcome of litigation; and failure of internal controls or corporate governance policies and procedures.1The estimated impact of the Tax Act, which is included in GAAP net income and equity, but excluded from operating earnings as defined, is a preliminary estimate and may be adjusted for the current and future periods, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of the Company’s calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, tax guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act.2SIGNATURES    "

As determined in the discretion of Aflac's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kirsch's employment under the Amended Agreement may be terminated for cause in the event of his: (i) willful and deliberate failure to substantially perform his duties under the Amended Agreement; (ii) willful and deliberate conduct resulting in substantial injury or damage to Aflac; or (iii) the conviction or plea of guilty to a felony. The Amended Agreement also revises the severance benefit payable to Mr. Kirsch upon his termination without ""good reason"" (as defined in the Amended Agreement). Consistent with the severance benefit payable generally to other senior Company executives upon such termination, and subject to Mr. Kirsch’s execution of a release of claims, in addition to the accrued benefits to which he was already entitled under his prior agreement (for example, base salary through his termination date), the Amended Agreement provides for (i) the payment of his annual performance bonus at the level of Aflac's actual performance, prorated through the date of his termination, and (ii) subject to their terms, the continued right to exercise his vested equity awards.The Amended Agreement also provides a new severance benefit to Mr. Kirsch in the event that, within three years following a change in control, Aflac terminates his employment without cause or Mr. Kirsch terminates his employment for good reason. Consistent with the severance benefit provided generally to other senior Company executives in such circumstances, in the event of such a termination and subject to his execution of a release of claims, the Amended Agreement provides that Mr. Kirsch will receive: (i) a lump-sum payment equal to three (3) times the sum of (x) his base salary plus (y) the higher of the annual performance bonus in the year preceding the year in which the change in control occurs or the year in which the change in control occurs, provided that if such termination occurs more than 24 months following the change in control, he will be entitled to receive the non-change in control salary continuation and prorated target performance bonus severance benefits; (ii) a lump-sum amount equal to his annual performance bonus at the maximum level of performance, prorated based on the number of days he is employed during the year of termination; (iii) 36 months' benefit continuation; and (iv) accelerated vesting of then-outstanding equity awards with performance-based awards vesting at the maximum level of performance. No severance payable following a change in control is subject to a gross-up for golden parachute excise taxes, and if the amounts payable to Mr. Kirsch otherwise would be subject to those taxes, the payment amount will be reduced to the maximum amount that will not trigger those taxes.The foregoing description of the change to Mr. Kirsch's prior agreement (as reflected in the Amended Agreement) is a summary of those changes only and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amended Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.1Item 9.01  Financial Statements and Exhibits.(d) Exhibits.10.1 - Employment Agreement dated as of December 1, 2015 by and between Aflac and Eric M.

248,ANSS,stay,2014-03-11 16:40:34,"March 5, 2014, the Compensation Committee of ANSYS, Inc. (the “Company”) approved an amendment and restatement of the ANSYS, Inc. Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was previously filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 6, 2010. The ANSYS, Inc. Second Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan”) will apply to awards made beginning in 2014 and in subsequent years, but does not change any of the terms and conditions of awards previously made under such plan. The Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan continues to award a target number of restricted stock units that can be earned based upon the percentage total shareholder return of the Company’s common stock over a defined performance period (the “Total Shareholder Return”) as compared to the percentage appreciation of the NASDAQ Composite Total Returns Index (the “Index”) over the same period of time. However, the Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan divides each three-year performance period (the “Performance Measurement Period”) into three sub-periods of overlapping one, two and three-year periods, with one-third of the target number of restricted stock units allocated to each sub-period. A participant may earn between 0% to 150% of the applicable portion of the target award in each sub-period, but any such earned portion of the target award will not become vested and settled unless the participant remains employed with the Company until the end of the full three-year performance cycle. 100% of the applicable portion of the target award for each sub-period will be earned if Total Shareholder Return equals the Index over the same period. The applicable portion of the target award will be reduced by three percentage points for each percent by which the Index exceeds Total Shareholder Return but with the applicable portion of the target reduced to 0% if the Index exceeds Total Shareholder Return by 25% or more. In addition, 0% of the applicable portion of the target will be earned for any sub-period in which there is both a negative Total Shareholder Return and the Index exceeds Total Shareholder Return. The applicable portion of the target award will be increased by two percentage points for each percent by which Total Shareholder Return exceeds the Index, up to maximum of 150% of the target. If, however, there is negative Total Shareholder Return that still exceeds the Index, a maximum of 100% of the target may be earned for such period. Under the Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan, a participant can also obtain retroactive credit for a previous sub-period within the same Performance Measurement Period if Total Shareholder Return as compared to the Index over the full three-year Performance Measurement Period is greater than the comparative Total Shareholder Return against the Index in any earlier one or two year sub-period within the full three-year Performance Measurement Period. The foregoing summary of the Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan, which is being filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  In connection with the adoption of the Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan, on March 5, 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Company also approved a new form of performance-based restricted stock unit agreement to be used for awards granted thereunder based on Total Shareholder Return, as described above, which is being filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2, and incorporated herein by reference, as well as a new form of performance-based restricted stock unit agreement to be used for awards granted under the ANSYS, Inc.

253,T,stay,2018-03-22 17:05:45,"March 22, 2018, we provided updated information regarding certain items impacting the first quarter of 2018.      The areas discussed below do not change the annual guidance we provided on January 31, 2018 in our Item 2.02 Form 8-K.     REVENUE RECOGNITION   Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" as modified (ASC 606), using the modified retrospective method. With our adoption of the revenue standard, we made a policy election to record certain revenue-based regulatory fees, primarily Universal Service Fund (USF) fees, on a net basis.      When using the modified retrospective approach, prior period results are not restated to reflect the impact of ASC 606, resulting in limited comparability between 2018 and 2017 operating results. As a convenience to investors who may want to consider the effects of certain aspects of ASC 606 on our 2017 operating results, we are providing a summary of the areas with the most significant impacts to AT&T and approximate impacts based on our 2017 transactions. These approximate impacts are intended to illustrate general changes in categories and are not proposed pro forma adjustments to the financial results and operations included in our Form 10-K filed February 20, 2018.     ASC 606 most significantly impacts AT&T in these three areas:  1) bundled service and equipment contracts, 2) deferral of commission costs, and 3) netting of certain regulatory fees, previously recognized in both revenue and expense. Additional details for these three areas and illustrative impacts on operating items follow in the tables below (increases are denoted ""+"" and decreases ""-"").                OTHER CHANGES IMPACTING HISTORICAL RESULTS  Consolidated Statements of Income   With our adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, ""Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost"" (ASU 2017-07), our consolidated statements of income have been adjusted to remove certain components of our net periodic benefit cost from our consolidated operating expenses and include those amounts in ""other income (expense) – net."" For segment reporting, we continue to include service cost and amortization of net prior service credits in segment operating results as this is the basis on which we analyze our segment results. While operating income is impacted by this standard change, net income and earnings per share are not impacted. The following table summarizes the increase (decrease) on our consolidated income statement.          Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows  With our adoption of ASU No. 2016-15, ""Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments"" (ASU 2016-15), our previously reported consolidated statements of cash flows have been adjusted to remove any additional cash received for installment receivables (i.e., AT&T Next) sold to the banks from operating activities and to include those receipts as cash from investing activities. We will continue to record cash received from the banks at the time of sale as cash from operating activities. Modifications made to our securitization program in 2017 should moderate the ongoing impact of ASU 2016-15 as we collect more cash upfront when installment receivables are sold to the banks. The following table summarizes the impact to cash from operations and cash from investing:                CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  Information set forth in this filing contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

260,T,up,2018-01-31 16:01:25,"a reported basis, our fourth-quarter 2017 revenues were $41.7 billion, down 0.4 percent from the fourth-quarter 2016, and full-year 2017 revenues were $160.5 billion, down 2.0 percent from the previous full year. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 revenues reflect continued declines in our legacy services and lower wireless service revenues, with pressure in domestic video revenue and storm credits also impacting the fourth-quarter. These decreases were partially offset by growth in International and fixed strategic services, with higher wireless equipment revenues also impacting the fourth-quarter. Compared with results for the fourth quarter of 2016, operating expenses were $41.3 billion, up 9.9 percent and full-year 2017 operating expenses were $139.6 billion, up 0.1 percent from the previous full year; fourth-quarter operating income was $0.4 billion, compared to $4.2 billion in the prior-year comparable period and full-year 2017 operating income was $20.9 billion, down 14.0 percent from the full-year 2016; and AT&T's fourth-quarter operating income margin was 0.9 percent, compared to 10.2 percent and full-year 2017 operating income margin was 13.0 percent compared to 14.9 percent. The year-over-year quarter changes are primarily due to the noncash adjustments related to a copper abandonment charge and pension and postemployment benefit accounting. For the full year, cash from operating activities was $39.2 billion, down from $39.3 billion in 2016, reflecting $1.0 billion in voluntary employee-related cash payments arising from tax reform.     Many of our products, including AT&T Mobility and AT&T U-verse® (U-verse), are offered to subscribers in multiple segments. Accordingly, to aid in understanding subscriber trends, we are presenting an overall discussion of these customer metrics. We reported a net gain of 4.1 million North American wireless subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which 2.7 million were domestic. At December 31, 2017, our North American wireless customer base was approximately 156.7 million compared to 146.8 million in the prior year, and our domestic wireless subscribers totaled 141.6 million compared to 134.9 million. During the fourth quarter, net adds in North America were as follows:                                   For the majority of our U.S. customers, we no longer offer service plans that allow for subsidized devices, instead we allow for subscribers to purchase devices on installment (AT&T Next) or to bring their own device (BYOD). During 2016, we introduced an integrated offer that allows for unlimited wireless data when combined with our video services, and, in the first quarter of 2017, we expanded our unlimited wireless data plans to make them available to customers that do not subscribe to our video services. At December 31, 2017, Mobile Share and unlimited plans represented nearly 90 percent of our domestic wireless postpaid smartphone base.     Sales under our equipment installment programs, including AT&T Next, represented 84 percent of all postpaid smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold 6.1 million smartphones under our AT&T Next program and had BYOD gross adds of 643,000. At December 31, 2017, about 54 percent of the postpaid smartphone base is on AT&T Next compared to approximately 52 percent at December 31, 2016.     At December 31, 2017, we had 38.9 million video subscribers (including 1.2 million DIRECTV NOW) compared with 38.0 million at December 31, 2016. Including the impact of gains from our over-the-top video service, DIRECTV NOW, total video subscribers increased by 299,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which 160,000 were in the U.S.     Our total broadband connections were 15.7 million at December 31, 2017, and 15.6 million at December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter, we added 103,000 IP broadband subscribers, for a total of 14.5 million at December 31, 2017. Total broadband subscribers increased by 4,000 in the quarter.     At December 31, 2017, our total switched access lines were 11.8 million compared with 14.0 million at December 31, 2016. The number of U-verse voice connections (which use VoIP technology and therefore are not included in the access line total) decreased by 93,000 in the quarter, totaling 5.7 million at December 31, 2017, compared to 5.8 million at December 31, 2016.     Segment Summary  Business Solutions  Revenues from our Business Solutions (Business) segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $18.4 billion, up 2.0 percent versus the year-ago quarter driven by higher wireless equipment revenue and growth in strategic services, partially offset by declines in our legacy services. Fourth-quarter 2017 Business operating expenses totaled $14.6 billion, up 3.9 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2016, largely due to increased sales volumes and depreciation expense increases that were partially offset by cost efficiencies. The Business operating margin was 20.8 percent, compared to 22.3 percent in the year-earlier quarter due to higher wireless sales costs partially offset by growth in IP revenues and increased operational efficiencies.     We had approximately 90.4 million business wireless subscribers at December 31, 2017 compared to 81.4 million at December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, business wireless net adds for connected devices were 2.6 million and postpaid net adds were 221,000. Postpaid business wireless subscriber churn was 1.08 percent, compared to 1.11 percent in the year-ago quarter.     During the fourth quarter of 2017, we added 7,000 high-speed internet business subscribers, bringing total business IP broadband to 1.0 million subscribers. Total business broadband had a loss of 16,000 subscribers in the quarter.           Entertainment Group  Our Entertainment Group (Entertainment) segment includes the results of the U.S. satellite-based DIRECTV operations as well as broadband and wired voice services to domestic residential customers. Entertainment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $12.7 billion, down 3.5 percent versus the year-ago quarter due to continued pressure in video revenues, driven by declines in linear video subscribers, lower revenues from legacy voice and data products and decreased broadband revenues reflecting simplified pricing and bundle discounts. Fourth-quarter 2017 Entertainment operating expenses totaled $11.7 billion down 1.4 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was largely driven by cost synergies that were predominately offset by annual content-cost increases, higher deferral amortization expense, an extra week of NFL SUNDAY TICKET® and new video platform expenses. The Entertainment operating margin was 8.4 percent, compared to 10.3 percent in the year-earlier quarter with cost efficiencies partially offsetting declines in revenues and increased expense pressure from programming and video platform costs.     At December 31, 2017, Entertainment had approximately 49.6 million revenue connections, compared to 51.0 million at December 31, 2016, which included:                 Consumer Mobility  Revenues from our Consumer Mobility segment, which consist of consumer, wholesale and resale subscribers located in the U.S., for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $8.3 billion, down 1.7 percent versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting a $361 million decline in postpaid service revenues primarily due to migrations of customers to our Business segment. This decline was partially offset by an increase of $120 million in prepaid service revenues and higher equipment revenue. Fourth-quarter 2017 Consumer Mobility operating expenses totaled $6.3 billion, up 0.3 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting higher smartphone sales offset by increased operational efficiencies and lower depreciation expense. The Consumer Mobility operating margin was 24.4 percent, compared to 26.0 percent in the year-earlier quarter due to service revenue pressure partially offset by increased cost efficiencies and lower depreciation.     We had approximately 51.1 million Consumer Mobility subscribers at December 31, 2017 compared to 53.5 million at December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we had branded net adds of 460,000 (postpaid net adds were 320,000 and prepaid net adds were 140,000). Consumer reseller had a net loss of 533,000. Our business wireless offerings allow for individual subscribers to purchase wireless services through employer-sponsored plans for a reduced price. The migration of these subscribers to the Business segment negatively impacted Consumer postpaid subscriber and service revenues growth.     Total customer churn of Consumer Mobility subscribers was 2.48 percent versus 2.43 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, including postpaid churn of 1.18 percent, compared to 1.25 percent in the year-ago quarter.           International  Our International segment consists of the Latin American operations and Mexican wireless operations. Fourth-quarter 2017 operating revenues were $2.2 billion, up 16.0 percent versus the prior year. Video service revenues in Latin America were $1.4 billion, up 10.3% versus the prior year, and wireless revenues in Mexico were $824 million, up 27.2% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Our DIRECTV Latin America revenues reflect pricing increases driven by macroeconomic conditions with mixed local currencies in our DIRECTV Latin America operations. Our Mexican wireless revenues reflect subscriber growth and increased equipment sales, partially offset by competitive pricing. Operating expenses were $2.2 billion compared to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The International operating margin was (1.5) percent, compared to (14.0) percent in the year-earlier quarter.     We had approximately 15.1 million Mexican wireless subscribers at December 31, 2017 compared to 12.0 million at December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we had branded net adds of 1.3 million (prepaid net adds were 1.2 million and postpaid net adds were 182,000).     We had approximately 13.6 million Latin America video connections at December 31, 2017 compared to 12.5 million at December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we had video net adds of 139,000.     Supplemental Discussion  As a supplemental discussion of our operating results, for comparison purposes, we are providing a view of our combined AT&T Mobility operations (domestic only). A reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers in this supplemental discussion is attached as an exhibit hereto.     AT&T Mobility revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $19.2 billion, up 2.5 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Wireless service revenues were pressured from customers migrating to plans with no overage charges and declines in reseller offset by higher equipment revenues and increased smartphone gross adds and upgrades than in the year-ago quarter. AT&T Mobility's operating income margin was 22.1 percent compared to 24.7 percent in the year-ago quarter reflecting pressure from higher smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the quarter partially offset by continued success in driving operating costs out of the business.     For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, postpaid phone-only ARPU decreased 2.6 percent versus the year-earlier quarter and 1.6 percent sequentially. Postpaid phone-only ARPU plus AT&T Next decreased 1.9 percent versus the year earlier quarter and 1.1 percent sequentially.     Postpaid phone only churn was 0.89 percent, compared to 0.98 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. Postpaid churn was 1.12 percent, compared to 1.16 percent in the year-ago quarter. Total customer churn was 1.38 percent versus 1.71 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.     On a standalone basis, including the impact of tax reform and the new ASC 606 revenue recognition standard, we expect in 2018:          Our guidance excludes pension and postemployment actuarial gains and losses, pending acquisitions and dispositions as well as any other significant items in year-over-year comparisons. Adjustments include noncash mark-to-market benefit plan gains and losses, merger-related interest expense, merger integration and amortization costs and other adjustments. Traditionally, the mark-to-market adjustment is the largest item, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between forecasted adjusted diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per share without unreasonable effort.

The company reiterates its full-year 2017 guidance of mid-single digit adjusted earnings growth, adjusted consolidated operating margin expansion, capital expenditures in the $22 billion range, and free cash flow at the low end of the $18 billion range.     Several devastating hurricanes, as well as earthquakes in Mexico, significantly impacted certain regions of our service area during the third quarter. Damage to our network and other property, costs to restore services, and revenue declines from waived charges will decrease our reported third-quarter 2017 consolidated revenues nearly $90 million and our reported pre-tax earnings about $210 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. We expect further reductions in the fourth quarter as we continue to assess damage to our network and fully restore service.     We also expect to report the following for the third quarter:                          Effective July 1, 2017, we are reporting prepaid Internet of Things (IoT) connections as a separate class within our subscriber categories.

This will result in 97,000 additional prepaid net adds in the quarter with a corresponding decline in connected device net adds.

These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs, similar to how Abbott’s management internally assesses performance.  Abbott’s management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott’s results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.

Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical through two mergers: (1) first, Vault Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott, was merged with and into St. Jude Medical, with St. Jude Medical surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott (the “First Merger”), and (2) second and promptly after the First Merger, St. Jude Medical was merged with and into Vault Merger Sub, LLC, with Vault Merger Sub, LLC surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott and being renamed St. Jude Medical, LLC (“SJM LLC”) (the “Second Merger” and together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”).   In the First Merger, each share of St. Jude Medical common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the first effective time was automatically converted into the right to receive 0.8708 of an Abbott common share and $46.75 in cash, without interest (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), with any fractional Abbott common shares to be settled in cash.   In connection with completion of the First Merger, vested options to purchase shares of St. Jude Medical common stock were deemed exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise and the net number of shares of St. Jude Medical common stock payable in respect thereto were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable withholding taxes, with any fractional Abbott common shares to be settled in cash. In addition, unvested options and restricted stock units in respect of St. Jude Medical common stock were assumed by Abbott and converted into Abbott options and restricted stock units (as applicable) of substantially equivalent value, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.   Based on the closing price of $39.36 for an Abbott common share on the New York Stock Exchange on January 4, 2017, the aggregate implied value of the consideration paid in connection with the Mergers was approximately $23.6 billion, including approximately $10 billion in Abbott common shares and approximately $13.6 billion in cash.

On the Merger Date, pursuant to the Merger, holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings (other than Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings itself), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture plc leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc with a nominal value of $0.0000225 per share in exchange for each ordinary share of Accenture Holdings with a nominal value of €0.000001 per share owned at the effective time of the Merger.  In connection with the Merger, Accenture plc issued a total of 25,554,372 Class A ordinary shares to holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings (other than Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings itself) at the effective time of the Merger. As part of the substantive application brought by Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings for a final order confirming the Merger, the High Court of Ireland (the “Irish High Court”) held a hearing at which all interested parties, including all holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings, had a right to appear and of which adequate notice had been given. At the hearing, the Irish High Court confirmed the fairness of the terms and conditions (both procedurally and substantively) of the Merger to holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings. Accenture plc’s issuance of Class A ordinary shares in connection with the Merger was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), by virtue of Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act.     In connection with the Merger, by operation of law effective on the Merger Date, (i) all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings were acquired by Accenture plc, (ii) each holder of Accenture Holdings’ ordinary shares (other than Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings itself) received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc in exchange for each ordinary share of Accenture Holdings held by such holder at the effective time of the Merger, (iii) all legal proceedings pending by or against Accenture Holdings are continued with the substitution, for Accenture Holdings, of Accenture plc as a party, and (iv) contracts, agreements and instruments to which Accenture Holdings was a party are construed and have effect as if Accenture plc had been a party thereto instead of Accenture Holdings, and Accenture plc has the same rights and is subject to the same obligations to which Accenture Holdings was subject under such contracts, agreements and instruments. Therefore, as a result of the Merger, holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings became holders of Class A ordinary shares of Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings ceased to exist.  In addition, on the Merger Date, Accenture plc redeemed, without any action on the part of the former holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings, the outstanding Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc held by the former holders of ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings in accordance with Accenture plc’s articles of association. Accordingly, Accenture plc intends to file a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to terminate the registration of the Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and to suspend its reporting obligations under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act with respect to Class X ordinary shares.

406,ATVI,down,2016-11-25 17:15:15,"November 22, 2016, Activision Blizzard, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an employment agreement (the “Employment Agreement”) with Robert A. Kotick, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who has served in this position for over 25 years and has been instrumental in creating value for the Company’s shareholders. The Employment Agreement is effective as of October 1, 2016 and will expire on December 31, 2021, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Employment Agreement.  Mr. Kotick will continue to receive his current base salary for the remainder of 2016 at the annual rate of $2,366,757. Beginning January 1, 2017 Mr. Kotick’s base salary will be reduced to the annual rate of $1,750,000.   The Employment Agreement also provides for an annual bonus based upon achievement of certain financial and business objectives determined by the Compensation Committee.  For the remainder of 2016, Mr. Kotick will continue to have a target annual bonus equal to 200% of his 2016 base salary specified above.  Beginning with the 2017 fiscal year, the target annual bonus for each fiscal year shall be equal to 200% of Mr. Kotick’s reduced base salary.  The bonus will be paid in the form determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) in its discretion, including cash, shares of Company common stock, stock options or equity-based awards.   The Employment Agreement includes significant changes from Mr. Kotick’s prior employment agreement that expired on June 30, 2016.  Among other changes, the Employment Agreement eliminates any “gross up” payments for Internal Revenue Code Section 280G “golden parachute” excise taxes and all change in control payments to which Mr. Kotick may be entitled under the Employment Agreement are “double-trigger” (i.e. require the occurrence of a change in control and a termination event).  The Employment Agreement does not provide for any guaranteed annual base salary increases.  In addition, the Employment Agreement provides for annual equity grants, instead of an up-front grant structure, and includes additional performance conditions and Compensation Committee discretion as to the form and total value of the annual awards, as described below.  The Employment Agreement also provides for additional awards and payments in the event of a “Transformative Transaction” (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and in the event that certain “Shareholder Value Creation” metrics are satisfied prior to December 31, 2021, as described below.   In consideration for entering into the Employment Agreement, the Employment Agreement provides that, as soon as practicable following the effective date of the Employment Agreement, the Company will grant Mr. Kotick an award of performance share units (the “2016 Performance Share Units”) on such terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee.  This award was made on November 22, 2016 and is described below under the heading “2016 Long Term Performance Share Grant.”           Section 6(a) of the Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Kotick will be granted future equity incentive awards for each of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 fiscal years.  The target value on the date of grant of each such award will be determined by the Compensation Committee after taking into account the Company’s and Mr. Kotick’s performance, the Company’s applicable peer companies, any relevant changes in the business and market dynamics relevant to the Company, the Company’s projected performance relative to its long-term business plan and any other factors the Compensation Committee determines relevant, but in no event will the value be equal to not less than the greatest of (1) the 50th percentile of the Company’s then-applicable group of peer companies; (2) with respect to the 2017 long-term incentive award, an amount that bears the same general relationship as the grant value of the 2016 Performance Share Unit Award has to the Company’s group of peer companies’ long-term incentive grant values; or (3) with respect to long-term incentive awards in years after 2016, the grant date value of the annual equity awards granted to Mr. Kotick in the immediately preceding fiscal year.  The Employment Agreement provides that the form, amount and terms and conditions of these future equity awards will be determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion after consultation with Mr. Kotick.   In addition, the Employment Agreement provides that on or about March 1, 2021, Mr. Kotick will be paid, subject to performance and continued employment, an incentive award (the “2020 Long-Term Performance Grant”) having a grant date value (“2020 Long Term Performance Grant Target Value”) determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion after consultation with Mr. Kotick according to the valuation criteria applicable to long-term grant values described in Section 6(a) of the Employment Agreement, and a maximum aggregate value at the date of payment (the “Maximum 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Value”) of 500% of the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Target Value.  The 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant may be paid in shares of Company common stock or cash, as determined by the Compensation Committee.  Except as noted following the table below, the share or cash value that shall be paid to Mr. Kotick shall be zero if the Company’s annualized total shareholder return (“TSR”) for the period commencing January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2020 (the “2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Measurement Period”) is less than six percent.  In the event that the Company’s compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) for TSR during the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Measurement Period is six percent or greater, the share value or cash value that shall be paid shall be determined as a percentage of the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Target Value in accordance with the following:      If CAGR for TSR during the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Measurement Period is 25% or more, the payment as a percentage of the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Target Value will be the Maximum 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Value.           The Employment Agreement provides for payments to Mr. Kotick pursuant to the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant if the Company’s annualized TSR for the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Measurement Period is less than six percent but equals or exceeds the median total shareholder return of the companies listed in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index for the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Measurement Period.  The amounts payable in this event range from 90% to 120% of the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Target Value depending on how the Company’s TSR compares to the median total shareholder return of the companies listed in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index for the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Measurement Period, but shall be limited to the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Target Value if the Company’s annualized TSR is negative during the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant Measurement Period.  For all purposes, straight-line interpolation will apply to performance levels between the levels set forth in this paragraph.   Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, Mr. Kotick will also be granted an incentive award (the “2021 Long-Term Performance Grant”) having a grant date value determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion after consultation with Mr. Kotick according to the valuation criteria applicable to long-term grant values described in Section 6(a), but based on an assumed increase in the long-term incentive values among companies in the Company’s general industry by applying a multiple of 1.44 to the grant date value of Mr. Kotick’s 2017 long-term incentive award (the “2021 Long-Term Performance Grant Value”).  The maximum share value or cash value under the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant will be 1.5 times the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant Value (the “Maximum 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant Value”).  Except as otherwise provided in the Employment Agreement, the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant will be paid in fiscal year 2022.  The amount payable under the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant will, except as provided in the Employment Agreement, be based on the Company’s cumulative annual operating income for the period commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending with December 31, 2021 (the “Cumulative OI”) and shall vest on March 31, 2022 if, and only if, the Compensation Committee determines that the Cumulative Operating Income is 90% or more of the sum of the 2017 through 2021 annual operating plan operating income objectives, with such operating income objectives for purposes of the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant to be the same as the 2017 through 2018 annual operating plan OI Objectives applicable to Mr. Kotick’s 2016 Performance Share Unit award, and to be determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion after consultation with Mr. Kotick for each of 2019, 2020 and 2021 (collectively, the “Cumulative OI Objectives”).  If the Cumulative OI falls at any point between 90% and 100% of the Cumulative OI Objectives, the share or cash value that will be received by Mr. Kotick with regard to the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant on the applicable vesting date shall be equal to the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant Value.  If the Cumulative OI is 125% of the Cumulative OI Objectives, the share or cash value that Mr. Kotick will receive with regard to the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant on the applicable vesting date will be equal to the Maximum Long-Term Performance Grant Value.  If the Cumulative OI is greater than 100% but less than 125% of the Cumulative OI Objectives, the share or cash value that will be received with regard to the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant on the applicable vesting date shall be determined based on straight line interpolation between 100% of the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant Value and the Maximum Long-Term Performance Grant Value.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee in its discretion may determine, following consultation with Mr. Kotick, that the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant shall vest based on a five year operating income operating plan approved by the Compensation Committee rather than the foregoing criteria.   In addition, if the Company consummates (and the Compensation Committee certifies that the Company has consummated), a Transformative Transaction (as defined in the Employment Agreement, and as determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee) during the term of Mr. Kotick’s employment while he is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Kotick will receive an award in shares or cash equal to between one hundred percent (100%) and one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant Value, as determined in accordance with the Employment Agreement, and dependent upon the accretive value added to the Company’s market capitalization, as determined by the Compensation Committee.           The Employment Agreement provides that, in the event that at any time prior to December 31, 2021 the closing trading price of a share of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds two times the average closing price of the Company’s common stock as determined during the period from October 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, subject to certain adjustments, and remains at or above that level for at least 90 consecutive trading days (the “Shareholder Value Creation Date”), (A) any of Mr. Kotick’s then outstanding equity compensation granted under Section 6(a) of the Employment Agreement will become vested with respect to 100% of the shares subject thereto (with the number of shares subject to performance based awards determined assuming attainment of the maximum level of performance); (B) a payment in shares or cash (as determined by the Compensation Committee) equal to the grant date value (as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion after consultation with Mr. Kotick) of any annual equity grants remaining to be made pursuant to Section 6(a) shall be made 120 days after the Shareholder Value Creation Date; and (C) the 2021 Long Term Performance Grant will be paid 120 days after the Shareholder Value Creation Date, with the amount payable to be no less than 1.5 times the 2021 Long Term Performance Grant Value.   Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, Mr. Kotick will also be eligible to participate in all health, welfare, pension, life insurance, disability and similar plans, programs and arrangements generally available to the Company’s U.S.-based senior executive group.  In addition, through March 15, 2022, the Company will reimburse Mr. Kotick for the cost of maintaining the life insurance policy in effect pursuant to Mr. Kotick’s prior employment agreement. Commencing on March 16, 2022 and continuing until the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Employment Agreement, the Company will reimburse Mr. Kotick up to a maximum of $80,000 per year for the cost of maintaining his then-existing life insurance policies.  The Company will pay reasonable expenses related to Mr. Kotick’s use of non-commercial transportation services for business-related travel, including use of transportation and aviation services provided by Cove Aviation Partners, LLC, a FAA certified charter operator indirectly owned and managed by Mr. Kotick, as previously approved by the Company’s Audit Committee.   In the event of a termination of Mr. Kotick’s employment as a result of Mr. Kotick’s  termination for Cause or Mr. Kotick’s resignation other than for Good Reason (each as defined in the Employment Agreement), the Company will pay to Mr. Kotick (i) his annual base salary through the date of such termination, any earned but unpaid annual bonus due to him, and any reimbursement due to him pursuant to Section 4 of the Employment Agreement (the “Accrued Obligations”) and Mr. Kotick will not be entitled to any additional severance payments.   In the event of a termination of Mr. Kotick’s employment as a result of his death or disability, the Company will pay to Mr. Kotick or his beneficiaries (as applicable) (i) the Accrued Obligations; (ii) an amount equal to the annual bonus earned by Mr. Kotick for the immediately preceding fiscal year pro rated for the number of days he worked during the fiscal year (“Pro Rata Annual Bonus”); (iii) in the case of termination due to disability, an amount equal to one times his base salary; (iv) continuation of health/medical coverage for Mr. Kotick and his spouse and minor children on a non-taxable basis for two years; (v) immediate vesting of all Company equity or equity-based awards with time-based vesting, and  all outstanding options to purchase Company stock shall remain exercisable until the earlier of five years from the termination date or the original expiration date of the options; and (vi) all outstanding Company equity or equity-based awards with performance-based vesting, the 2020 Long-Term Performance Grant and the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant (together, the “Performance-Based Awards”) will remain outstanding and become vested based on the actual attainment of such awards’ performance targets as if Mr. Kotick were still employed through the time of vesting.           In the event Mr. Kotick’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or he resigns his employment for Good Reason, other than during the 12-month period following a Change of Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement), then conditioned on Mr. Kotick’s execution of a release of any claims against the Company, he will receive (i) the Accrued Obligations; (ii) an amount equal to the annual bonus Mr. Kotick earns for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, pro-rated for the number of days he worked during the fiscal year (the “Current Pro Rata Annual Bonus”); (iii) an amount equal to two times his base salary and target value of his 2016 annual bonus; (iv) continuation of health/medical coverage for Mr. Kotick and his spouse and minor children on a non-taxable basis for two years; (v) immediate vesting of all Company equity or equity-based awards with time-based vesting, and all outstanding options to purchase Company stock will remain exercisable until the earlier of five years from the termination date or the original expiration date of the options; and (vi) all Performance-Based Awards will remain outstanding and become vested based on the actual attainment of such awards’ performance targets as if Mr. Kotick were still employed through the time of vesting.   If Mr. Kotick’s employment is terminated during the 12-month period following a Change of Control by the Company without Cause, or by Mr. Kotick for Good Reason, he will be entitled to (i) the Accrued Obligations; (ii) the Current Pro Rata Annual Bonus; (iii) an amount equal to three times his base salary and target value of his 2016 annual bonus; (iv) continuation of health/medical coverage for Mr. Kotick and his spouse and minor children on a non-taxable basis for two years; (v) immediate vesting of all Company equity or equity-based awards with time-based vesting, and all outstanding options to purchase Company stock will remain exercisable until the earlier of five years from the termination date or the original expiration date of the options; and (vi) all Performance-Based Awards will remain outstanding and become vested based on the actual attainment of such awards’ performance targets as if Mr. Kotick were still employed through the time of vesting.  In addition, all of Mr. Kotick’s options will remain exercisable until their original expiration date, and Mr. Kotick will immediately vest in and be paid the 2016 Performance Share Units, the 2020 Long Term Performance Grant and the 2021 Long-Term Performance Grant, based on the greater of (x) target performance and (y) actual performance as determined by the Compensation Committee based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of projected performance through the end of each applicable performance period.

The Amended Bylaws amend and restate the Second Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company (the “Former Bylaws”), adopting certain changes, including those summarized below:   ·              The Amended Bylaws eliminate certain governance provisions that are no longer necessary now that Vivendi S.A. is no longer the Company’s controlling stockholder, including the following:   ·              Provisions requiring “supermajority” approval for the amendment of the bylaws, consistent with the changes to the Company’s certificate of incorporation approved by the Company’s stockholders at their 2014 annual meeting;   ·              A provision specifying that certain items need to receive the vote of a majority of the independent directors, voting separately, in addition to the vote of a majority of the Board (e.g., declaration of dividends); and   ·              Provisions specifically delineating the authority of the Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) and the limits on that authority, neither of which are customary in public company bylaws and which were only added to the Former Bylaws as a result of its relationship with Vivendi S.A (e.g., the requirements that the Board approve transactions in excess of $30 million, the issuance of securities and any change in compensation for any person whose annual cash compensation exceeds $2 million); these provisions were replaced with more general language with respect to the CEO’s authority.   ·              The majority voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections was clarified to explicitly provide that the number of shares voted “for” a director must exceed the number of shares voted “against” the director. In conjunction with this change, the Board also amended the Company’s Corporate Governance Principles and Policies to provide that, if stockholders do not re-elect a director, that director must offer his or her resignation from the Board. In that instance, the Board, or, at the Board’s direction, the Company’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, would determine whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Company would publicly disclose the decision and the underlying rationale within 90 days following the date of the certification of the election results.   ·              The Amended Bylaws permit the Chairman of the Board, the CEO, the President or a majority of the Board then in office to call special meetings of stockholders.   ·              Certain governance provisions regarding business transacted at stockholders’ meetings were amended, including the following:   ·              Provisions were added clarifying and  establishing certain notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations, including:   2         ·              Requiring a stockholder’s notice to the Company with regard to director nominees proposed by stockholders to include a more fulsome disclosure (e.g., the material interest of the director nominee and/or the person nominating him or her, the disclosure of any representations and agreements with respect to voting and compensation arrangements and a representation as to compliance with Company policies and guidelines);   ·              Requiring disclosure by persons proposing business of any action taken by such person to separate his or her voting interest from his or her economic interest; and   ·              Requiring the proposed text of any proposal regarding business to be discussed at a meeting.   ·              In order to clarify what constitutes a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and send its proxy materials pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Amended Bylaws provide that, with respect to special meetings and situations where an annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days of the anniversary date of the prior year’s annual meeting, the earliest date that a stockholder may provide notice of nominations or other business is 120 days prior to the meeting (the Former Bylaws provided such an “earliest date” restriction only for an annual meeting).   ·              The Amended Bylaws include a provision that the presiding person of a stockholder meeting has the power to adjourn it, whether or not there is a quorum.   ·              The Amended Bylaws clarify which officers are required to be elected by the Board, and explicitly permit the Board to empower the CEO to appoint (and remove) any other officers.   ·              The Amended Bylaws permit the Chairman of the Board, the CEO or a majority of the Board then in office to call special meetings of the Board.   ·              The Amended Bylaws consolidate and clarify the provisions relating to the manner and waiver of notice to shareholders and directors.   ·              The Amended Bylaws provide for certain non-substantive changes and changes to conform to current provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, including allowing for electronic notice of meetings and uncertified certificates.   The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended Bylaws, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Amendment will eliminate this financial covenant on the first calendar day following the last day of the Test Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ending on or immediately after the 2015 Closing Date (as defined in the Credit Agreement).   The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to a financial maintenance covenant requiring the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 4.00 to 1.00, which will decrease to 3.50 to 1.00 (I) after the sixth full fiscal quarter after the Tranche A Term Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) are made or (II) if the Collateral Suspension (as defined below) occurs prior to the date falling 18 months after the Tranche A Term Loans are made, on the later of (x) the last day of the fourth full fiscal quarter after the Tranche A Term Loans are made and (ii) the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the Collateral Suspension occurs.   The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the same collateral and guaranteed by the same guarantors that secured and guaranteed the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.  The security for the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility will be automatically suspended (the “Collateral Suspension”) if and for so long as (i) the Company’s initial term loans under the Credit Agreement are repaid in full, (ii) the Company has no other secured indebtedness for borrowed money (with limited exceptions) and (iii) the Company has an investment grade rating from either Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (or any of their successors).  If the Company incurs secured indebtedness for borrowed money that is not permitted following any suspension of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility security, the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility security will be reinstated.  The other terms of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility are generally the same as the terms of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.   2         A copy of the Amendment is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement.

425,ATVI,up,2015-11-17 14:46:24,"November 13, 2015, Activision Blizzard, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into the Second Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement, dated as of October 11, 2013 (as previously amended by the First Amendment, dated as of November 2, 2015, the “Existing Credit Agreement” and, as amended by the Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”), among the Company, as borrower, the guarantors from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the “Lenders”), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders, and the several other agents party thereto, primarily to amend certain terms and conditions of the Tranche B-2 Term Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement).  Tranche B-2 Term Loans as amended by the Amendment are herein referred to as the “Tranche A Term Loans.”   Prior to the Amendment, the Existing Credit Agreement provided for an approximately $2.3 billion Tranche B-2 Term Facility (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), which was amended pursuant to the Amendment into an approximately $2.3 billion Tranche A Term Facility (as defined in the Credit Agreement).   The Tranche A Term Loans are scheduled to mature on October 11, 2020 and will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (a) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate, plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for an interest period of one month beginning on such day plus 1.00%, or (b) LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable interest margin.  LIBOR will be subject to a floor of 0% and base rate will be subject to an effective floor of 1.00%.  The applicable interest margin for Tranche A Term Loans will range from 1.50% to 2.25% for LIBOR borrowings and from 0.50% to 1.25% for base rate borrowings and will be determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company’s Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement).   The Amendment requires quarterly principal payments of 0.625% of the stated principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loans, with increases to 1.250% starting on June 30, 2019 and 3.125% starting on June 30, 2020, with the remaining balance payable on the Tranche A Term Loans’ scheduled maturity date of October 11, 2020.  Voluntary prepayments of the Tranche A Term Loans are permitted at any time, in minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty.   The Tranche A Term Loans will be subject to a financial maintenance covenant requiring the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 4.00 to 1.00, which will decrease to 3.50 to 1.00 (I) after the sixth full fiscal quarter after the Tranche A Term Loans are made or (II) if the Collateral Suspension (as defined below) occurs prior to the date falling 18 months after the Tranche A Term Loans are made, on the later of (x) the last day of the fourth full fiscal quarter after the Tranche A Term Loans are made and (y) the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the Collateral Suspension occurs.   The Tranche A Term Loans will be secured by the same collateral and guaranteed by the same guarantors that secured and guaranteed the Tranche B-2 Term Loans; provided that the security for the Tranche A Term Loans will be automatically suspended (the “Collateral Suspension”) if and for so long as (i) the Company’s existing term loans under the Credit Agreement are repaid in full, (ii) the Company has no other secured indebtedness for borrowed money (with limited exceptions) and (iii) the Company has an investment grade rating from either Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

431,ADBE,up,2018-03-15 16:09:22,"March 15, 2018, Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 2, 2018. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expense; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (D) investment gains and losses; (E) income tax adjustments; and (F) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:A.     Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares, stock options and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.B.     Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact. During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.2C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships, and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development, and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.  Periodically, we also incur charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. D.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact.  We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities), and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.     Income tax adjustments. Our income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, resolution of certain income tax audits and any significant financial impacts resulting from tax legislation (including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) are made to help us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We evaluate this non-GAAP tax rate only on an annual basis. This non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for several reasons, including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. F.         Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.3Item 9.01.

The Committee established the Program to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance, and enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain highly talented individuals. Members of the Company’s executive management team and other key members of senior management were selected by the Committee to participate in the Program for fiscal year 2018.  The Committee granted awards to the executive officers under the Program on January 24, 2018 in the form of a target award and a maximum award of performance shares (“Performance Shares”), approved pursuant to the terms of the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.Under the Program, shares may be earned based on the achievement of objective relative total stockholder return (“TSR”) measured over a three-year performance period (Adobe’s 2018 - 2020 fiscal years).  The Committee will certify actual performance achievement following the Company’s 2020 fiscal year end and the corresponding number of Performance Shares earned for the three-year performance period, subject to specified change of control exceptions.  In addition, as a condition to earning any Performance Shares, a participant must continue to provide service to Adobe (or an affiliate) through the latter of the certification date and January 24, 2021. Accordingly, the Performance Shares will align our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders, while serving as a key retention mechanism over the long term.Each participant can earn between 0% and 200% (the payout cap under the Program) of his or her target number of Performance Shares.  The amount of Performance Shares actually earned is based on a relative three-year TSR measure, which objectively compares the TSR of Adobe’s common stock against the TSR of the companies included in the NASDAQ 100 Index as of December 2, 2017 (the first day of Adobe’s 2018 fiscal year) during the course of the three-year period.  Generally, TSR will be compared using the 90-calendar day average immediately preceding Adobe’s 2018 fiscal year and ending at the end of Adobe’s 2020 fiscal year.  The number of Performance Shares awarded will increase or decrease 2.5% for every percentile that Adobe’s TSR percentile rank is above or below, respectively, the NASDAQ 100 companies’ 50th percentile, and no shares will be awarded if the Company’s performance ranks below the 25th percentile for the three-year performance period. Additionally, regardless of Adobe’s relative position with respect to the NASDAQ 100 companies, the award will be capped at 100% of target in the case of Adobe having a negative absolute TSR over the measurement period. The target awards and maximum awards for the Performance Shares granted to the Company’s principal executive officer and other named executive officers* on January 24, 2018 are as set forth below. * For purposes of this filing, the term “named executive officer” refers to executive officers for whom disclosure was required in our most recent filing with the Securities Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that required disclosure pursuant to Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K.** As noted in Item 9B of the Company's 10-K filed on January 22, 2018, Mark Garrett notified the Company on January 22, 2018 of his intent to retire as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Adobe during 2018. Mr. Garrett did not receive an award under the Company's 2018 Performance Share Program. 2A participant may receive less than his or her target award, and in no event may actual shares earned exceed the maximum award.  Any shares issued under the Program are subject to recoupment in accordance with the Company’s clawback policies. The description of the Program contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Program, does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Program used in connection with the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 10.1.  Copies of the 2018 Performance Share Program and the form of Award Grant Notice and Performance Share Award Agreement for use in connection with grants under this Program are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.    2018 Executive Annual Incentive PlanOn January 24, 2018, the Committee approved the terms of the 2018 Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), adopted pursuant to the stockholder-approved 2016 Executive Cash Performance Bonus Plan (the “Master Bonus Plan”). The Incentive Plan applies to certain executive officers of the Company and is designed to drive revenue growth, encourage accountability, drive execution of short-term priorities tied to long-term strategy and annual operating plan objectives, and recognize and reward the Company’s executives upon the achievement of certain objectives. Executive officers designated by the Board as an officer for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, who are Senior Vice President level or above, and who are employed by the Company during its 2018 fiscal year are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan.  Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, each participant is eligible to receive an incentive bonus calculated as a percentage of his or her base salary.The Incentive Plan requires that the Company achieve at least 90% of the GAAP revenue target set forth in the annual operating plan for fiscal year 2018 as approved by the Board at the beginning of the fiscal year (the “FY18 Operating Plan”) as a minimum performance threshold before participants may earn any incentive bonus under the Incentive Plan.  If the initial threshold is not achieved, no payments may be made under the Incentive Plan.  If this initial threshold is achieved, each participant is eligible to earn a maximum bonus equal to 200% of such participant’s Target Award, up to a maximum of $5 million (the “Maximum Award”).  The “Target Award” is calculated by multiplying a participant’s base salary in effect at the end of the performance period by a Committee-approved target bonus percentage.For fiscal year 2018, the Target Award and Maximum Award, expressed as a percentage of base salary for the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers, would be as follows:  3The Maximum Award for each participant is subject to reduction based on the Company’s or the participant’s performance. A participant’s “Actual Award” is comprised of: *   Cannot exceed Target Award unless the Financial Performance Result (as set                       forth below) is at least 90%The Company’s financial performance for the performance period (“Financial Performance Result”) is comprised of both (1) net new annualized recurring revenue in Digital Media (“ARR”) and (2) net new subscription bookings for Digital Experience (“Bookings”).  The Financial Performance Result is calculated by averaging the ARR Performance Result and the Bookings Performance Result, which are percentages based off of the achievement of targets set forth in the FY18 Operating Plan, as shown on Exhibit A of the Incentive Plan. As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 1, 2017, we define ARR as the sum of Creative ARR and Document Cloud ARR. We define Creative ARR as the sum of: (1) the annual value of Creative Cloud subscriptions and services; plus (2) the annual contract value of Digital Publishing Suite; plus (3) the annual contract value of Creative Enterprise Term License Agreements. We define Document Cloud ARR as the sum of (1) the annual value of Document Cloud subscriptions and services, plus (2) the annual contract value of Document Cloud Enterprise Term License Agreements. The  Financial Performance Result is subject to adjustment by the Committee by up to 25 percentage points up or down based on the Committee’s assessment of the Company’s performance against its corporate priorities and objectives during the performance period (the “Strategic Performance Adjustment”).   This results in the “Corporate Performance Result” (expressed as a percentage). The “Individual Performance Result” is based on the Committee’s assessment of each participant's individual performance including, without limitation, achievement of individual performance goals set by the Committee at the outset of the performance period.   The goals are specifically tailored to each participant and aligned with the achievement of strategic objectives in the FY18 Operating Plan.  A participant’s Individual Performance Result may range from 0% to 200%.Once each component described above is certified by the Committee, the Actual Award earned by each participant under the Incentive Plan is determined using the formula included above, provided that in no event will a participant's Actual Award exceed their Target Award if the Financial Performance Result is not at least 90%.Any amounts paid under the Incentive Plan are subject to recoupment from participants in accordance with the Company’s clawback policies.The description of the Incentive Plan contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Incentive Plan, does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Incentive Plan and the Master Bonus Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 10.4.  A copy of the Incentive Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.5 and is incorporated herein by reference. 4Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits. (d) ExhibitsSIGNATURE "
433,ADBE,up,2017-12-14 16:05:56,"December 14, 2017, Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter ended December 1, 2017. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expense; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (D) investment gains and losses; (E) income tax adjustments; and (F) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:A.     Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares, stock options and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.B.     Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact. During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.2C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships, and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development, and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.  Periodically, we also incur charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. D.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact.  We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities), and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.     Income tax adjustments. Our income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our long-term non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition and resolution of certain income tax audits, are made to help us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate only on an annual basis. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a number of reasons, including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. Based on our long-term projections, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 21% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results in both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.F.         Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.3Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.On December 8, 2017, our Executive Compensation Committee approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated 2017 Executive Severance Plan in the Event of a Change of Control (the “Change of Control Plan”), to be effective on December 13, 2017. The Change of Control Plan is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.  The Change of Control Plan replaces Adobe’s 2014 Executive Severance Plan in the Event of a Change of Control, which terminated in accordance with its terms on December 13, 2017.Item 9.01.

Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.3Item 9.01.

437,ADBE,up,2017-03-16 16:06:38,"March 16, 2017, Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 3, 2017. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (D) investment gains and losses; (E) income tax adjustments; and (F) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:A.     Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares, stock options and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.B.     Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact. During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.2C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships, and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development, and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.  Periodically, we also incur charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. D.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact.  We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities), and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.     Income tax adjustments. Our income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our long-term non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition and resolution of certain income tax audits, are made to help us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate only on an annual basis. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a number of reasons, including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. Based on our long-term projections, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 21% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results in both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.F.     Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.3Item 9.01.

His decision to retire was previously announced in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 7, 2016. Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Adobe, will serve as the interim principal accounting officer while Adobe completes its search for Mr. Rowley’s replacement.(e)    2017 Performance Share ProgramOn January 24, 2017, the Executive Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company approved the 2017 Performance Share Program, including the Award Calculation Methodology (the “Program”), under the terms of the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.  The Committee established the Program to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance, and enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain highly talented individuals.  Members of the Company’s executive management team and other key members of senior management were selected by the Committee to participate in the Program for fiscal year 2017.  The Committee granted awards to the executive officers under the Program on January 24, 2017 in the form of a target award and a maximum award of performance shares (“Performance Shares”), approved pursuant to the terms of the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.Under the Program, shares may be earned based on the achievement of objective relative total stockholder return (“TSR”) measured over a three-year performance period (Adobe’s 2017 - 2019 fiscal years).  The Committee will certify actual performance achievement following the Company’s 2019 fiscal year end and the corresponding number of Performance Shares earned for the three-year performance period, subject to specified change of control exceptions.  In addition, as a condition to earning any Performance Shares, a participant must continue to provide service to Adobe (or an affiliate) through the latter of the certification date and January 24, 2020.  Accordingly, the Performance Shares will align our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders, while serving as a key retention mechanism over the long term.Each participant can earn between 0% and 200% (the payout cap under the Program) of his or her target number of Performance Shares.  The amount of Performance Shares actually earned is based on a relative three-year TSR measure, which objectively compares the TSR of Adobe’s common stock against the TSR of the companies included in the NASDAQ 100 Index as of December 3, 2016 (the first day of Adobe’s 2017 fiscal year) during the course of the three-year period.  Generally, TSR will be compared using the 90-calendar day average ending at the beginning of Adobe’s 2017 fiscal year and ending at the end of Adobe’s 2019 fiscal year.  The number of Performance Shares awarded will increase or decrease 2.5% for every percentile that Adobe’s TSR percentile rank is above or below, respectively, the NASDAQ 100 companies’ 50th percentile, and no shares will be awarded if the Company’s performance ranks below the 25th percentile for the three-year performance period. Additionally, regardless of Adobe’s relative position with respect to the NASDAQ 100 companies, the award will be capped at 100% of target in the case of Adobe having a negative absolute TSR over the measurement period. The target awards and maximum awards for the Performance Shares granted to the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers* on January 24, 2017 are as set forth below. 2* For purposes of this filing, the term “named executive officer” refers to executive officers for whom disclosure was required in our most recent filing with the Securities Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that required disclosure pursuant to Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K.A participant may receive less than his or her target award, and in no event may actual shares earned exceed the maximum award.  Any shares issued under the Program are subject to recoupment in accordance with the Company’s clawback policies. The description of the Program contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Program, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Program used in connection with the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 10.1.  Copies of the 2017 Performance Share Program and the form of Award Grant Notice and Performance Share Award Agreement for use in connection with grants under this Program are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.    2017 Executive Annual Incentive PlanOn January 24, 2017, the Committee approved the terms of the 2017 Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), adopted pursuant to the stockholder-approved 2016 Cash Performance Bonus Plan (the “Master Bonus Plan”). The Incentive Plan applies to certain executive officers of the Company and is designed to drive revenue growth, encourage accountability, drive execution of short-term priorities tied to long-term strategy and annual operating plan objectives, and recognize and reward the Company’s executives upon the achievement of certain objectives.Executive officers designated by the Company’s Board of Directors as an officer for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, who are Senior Vice President level or above and who are employed by the Company during its 2017 fiscal year are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan.  Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, each participant is eligible to receive an incentive bonus calculated as a percentage of his or her base salary.The Incentive Plan requires that the Company achieve at least 90% of the GAAP revenue target set forth in the annual operating plan for fiscal year 2017 as approved by the Board at the beginning of the fiscal year (the “FY17 Operating Plan”) as a minimum performance threshold before participants may earn any incentive bonus under the Incentive Plan.  If the initial threshold is not achieved, no payments may be made under the Incentive Plan.  If this initial threshold is achieved, each participant is eligible to earn a maximum bonus equal to 200% of such participant’s annual bonus target, up to a maximum of $5 million, subject to reduction as described below.  The target bonus is calculated by multiplying a participant’s base salary in effect at the end of the performance period by a Committee-approved target bonus percentage.For fiscal year 2017, the target bonus and maximum bonus, expressed as a percentage of base salary for the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers, would be as follows:  3The maximum bonus for each participant is subject to reduction based on the Company’s or the participant’s performance. Fifty percent of a participant’s target award opportunity is tied to the Corporate Performance Result and fifty percent of a participant’s target award opportunity is tied to his or her Individual Performance Result, each as described below. The actual bonus is comprised of:The “Corporate Performance Result” (expressed as a percentage) is the product of: (1) Financial Performance and (2) Customer Retention & Satisfaction.  The Company’s financial performance for the Performance Period (“Financial Performance”) is determined by a metric comprised of both (1) net new annualized recurring revenue in Digital Media and (2) net bookings for the Adobe Marketing Cloud (“Bookings”), in both cases as set forth in the FY17 Operating Plan.As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 2, 2016, we define annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, in our Digital Media business as the sum of Creative ARR and Document Cloud ARR. We define Creative ARR as the sum of: (1) the annual value of Creative Cloud subscriptions and services; plus (2) the annual contract value of Digital Publishing Suite; plus (3) the annual contract value of Creative Enterprise Term License Agreements. We define Document Cloud ARR as the sum of (1) the annual value of Document Cloud subscriptions and services; plus (2) the annual contract value of Document Cloud Enterprise Term License Agreements. The Bookings target for Adobe Marketing Cloud is also based on the target set forth in the FY17 Operating Plan. Financial Performance measures net new ARR in our Digital Media business and Bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud, both equally weighted, with the actual percentage of Financial Performance achievement determining the Financial Performance payout percentage (with a maximum achievement of 200%), as shown on Exhibit A of the Incentive Plan. The  Financial Performance is also subject to adjustment by the Committee by up to 20 percentage points up or down based on the Committee’s assessment of the Company’s qualitative performance during the fiscal year (with a maximum achievement of 200%).The Financial Performance payout percentage, after any adjustment as described in the preceding sentence, will cap the Corporate Performance Result.  The Corporate Performance Result may be adjusted downward based on the outcome of performance relative to Customer Retention and Satisfaction metrics (“Customer Retention & Satisfaction”) established by the Committee in consultation with the Board at the outset of the fiscal year.  The percentage achievement of Customer Retention & Satisfaction (assessed on a scale of 0% to 100%) is multiplied by the Financial Performance to determine the Corporate Performance Result. 4The remaining 50% of each participant’s bonus opportunity under the Incentive Plan is based on individual performance including, without limitation, achievement of individual performance goals selected by the Committee at the outset of the performance period, which goals are specifically tailored to each participant and aligned with the achievement of strategic objectives contained in the FY17 Operating Plan (the “Individual Performance Result”).  A participant’s Individual Performance Result may range from 0% to 200%.Once each component described above is certified by the Committee, the actual bonus award earned by each participant under the Incentive Plan is determined using the following formula:Any amounts paid under the Incentive Plan are subject to recoupment from participants in accordance with the Company’s clawback policies.The description of the Incentive Plan contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Incentive Plan, does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Incentive Plan and the 2016 Executive Cash Performance Bonus Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 10.4.

A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Adobe also provided certain financial targets for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the full year of fiscal 2017, and reaffirmed its long-term financial targets, a copy of which is furnished hereto as Exhibit 99.2.The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (D) accrued loss contingencies associated with one-time litigation events; (E) investment gains and losses; (F) gain on sale of property assets; (G) income tax adjustments; and (H) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.

We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. D.        Accrued loss contingencies associated with one-time litigation events.  In connection with ongoing litigation or similar events, we accrue losses in the event such losses are determined to be both probable and estimable in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20, Loss Contingencies. Upon resolution of the litigation or event, we adjust the accrual to reflect final resolution. From time to time we exclude such activity and the related tax impact when they relate to one-time events that are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact.  We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships.

We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.F.         Gain on sale of property assets and related tax impact.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we sold land and an unoccupied building located in San Jose, California. We exclude such gains and the related tax impact as they are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.G.     Income tax adjustments. Our income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our long-term non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, reenactment of the Federal Research and Development tax credit and resolution of income tax audits (such as occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016), are made to help us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate only on an annual basis. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a number of reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. Based on our long-term projections, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 21% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016.H.     Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.3Item 9.01.

444,ADBE,up,2016-09-20 16:06:33,"September 20, 2016, Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended September 2, 2016. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (D) accrued loss contingencies associated with one-time litigation events; (E) investment gains and losses; (F) income tax adjustments; and (G) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:A.     Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares, stock options and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.B.     Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact. During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. Restructuring and other charges are 2excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.  Periodically, we also incur charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. D.        Accrued loss contingencies associated with one-time litigation events.  In connection with ongoing litigation or similar events, we accrue losses in the event such losses are determined to be both probable and estimable in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20, Loss Contingencies. Upon resolution of the litigation or event, we adjust the accrual to reflect final resolution. From time to time we exclude such activity and the related tax impact when they relate to one-time events that are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.F.     Income tax adjustments. Our income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our long-term non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, reenactment of the Federal Research and Development tax credit and resolution of an income tax audit, are made to help us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate only on an annual basis. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a number of reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. Based on our long-term projections, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 21% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016.G.     Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.3Item 9.01.

The Restated Bylaws became effective immediately upon adoption by the Board as described below.The Restated Bylaws include a new Section 6 that permits a stockholder (or a group of up to twenty stockholders) owning at least three percent of Adobe’s outstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in Adobe’s annual meeting proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two directors or twenty percent of the Board, provided that the stockholders and nominees satisfy the requirements specified in the Restated Bylaws.The Restated Bylaws also require a stockholder who desires to nominate one or more persons for election as a member of the Board at Adobe’s annual meeting (other than through proxy access) to provide written notice to the company at least 90 days and no more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which Adobe released its proxy materials to its stockholders for the prior year’s annual meeting of stockholders.  Under the bylaws that were in effect prior to this amendment, the notice period for stockholder nominations to Adobe’s Board was between the 75th and 105th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which Adobe released its proxy materials for the prior year’s annual meeting of stockholders.  The Restated Bylaws also include other changes to the provisions in Sections 5, 7 and 16 to account for proxy access, changes to Section 21 to eliminate the requirement of an annual Board meeting, and a number of other administrative and conforming changes, including changes reflecting that, beginning at Adobe's 2013 annual meeting, all directors are elected annually.The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Restated Bylaws, which are filed as Exhibit 3.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

The Committee established the Program to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance, and enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain highly talented individuals.  Members of the Company’s executive management team and other key members of senior management were selected by the Committee to participate in the Program for fiscal year 2016.  The Committee granted awards to the executive officers under the Program on January 25, 2016 in the form of a target award and a maximum award of performance shares (“Performance Shares”), approved pursuant to the terms of the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.Under the Program, shares may be earned based on the achievement of objective relative total stockholder return (“TSR”) measured over a three-year performance period (Adobe’s 2016 - 2018 fiscal years).  The Committee will certify actual performance achievement following the Company’s 2018 fiscal year end and the corresponding number of Performance Shares earned for the three-year performance period, subject to specified change of control exceptions.  In addition, as a condition to earning any Performance Shares, a participant must continue to provide service to Adobe (or an affiliate) through the later of the certification date and January 24, 2019.  Accordingly, the Performance Shares will align our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders over the long term, while also providing key retention incentives.Each participant can earn between 0% and 200% (the payout cap under the Program) of his or her target number of Performance Shares.  The amount of Performance Shares actually earned is based on a relative three-year TSR measure, which objectively compares the TSR of Adobe’s common stock against the TSR of the companies included in the NASDAQ 100 Index as of November 28, 2015 (the first day of Adobe’s 2016 fiscal year) during the course of the three-year period.  Generally, TSR will be compared using the 90-calendar day average ending at the beginning of Adobe’s 2016 fiscal year and ending at the end of Adobe’s 2018 fiscal year.  The number of Performance Shares awarded will increase or decrease 2.5% for every percentile that Adobe’s TSR percentile rank is above or below, respectively, the NASDAQ 100 companies’ 50th percentile, and no shares will be awarded if the Company’s performance ranks below the 25th percentile for the three-year performance period. Additionally, regardless of Adobe’s relative position with respect to the NASDAQ 100 companies, the award will be capped at 100% of target in the case of Adobe having a negative absolute TSR over the measurement period. The target awards and maximum awards for the Performance Shares granted to the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers* on January 25, 2016 are as set forth below. The target award for Mr. Rencher reflects his promotion from Senior Vice President to Executive Vice President, effective as of January 25, 2016.2* For purposes of this filing, the term “named executive officer” refers to executive officers for whom disclosure was required in our most recent filing with the Securities Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that required disclosure pursuant to Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K. David Wadhwani is no longer with the Company and, as such, is not a participant in the Company's 2016 Performance Share Program.A participant may receive less than his or her target award, and in no event may actual shares earned exceed the maximum award.  Any shares issued under the Program are subject to recoupment in accordance with the Company’s clawback policies. The description of the Program contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Program, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Program used in connection with the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 10.1.  Copies of the 2016 Performance Share Program and the form of Award Grant Notice and Performance Share Award Agreement for use in connection with grants under this Program are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.2016 Executive Cash Performance Bonus PlanOn January 25, 2016, the Committee approved, subject to stockholder approval, a new 2016 Executive Cash Performance Bonus Plan (the “Master Bonus Plan”) and the Board of Directors directed that the Master Bonus Plan be submitted to the Company’s stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Stockholder approval of the Master Bonus Plan will allow bonuses paid under it to “covered employees” (as defined under Section 162(m) of the Code) to qualify as deductible “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. The Master Bonus Plan has substantially the same terms as the Company's 2011 Executive Cash Performance Bonus Plan. The purpose of the Master Bonus Plan is to motivate eligible employees to achieve goals relating to the performance of the Company or one of its business units or other objectively determinable goals, and to reward them when those objectives are satisfied, thereby increasing stockholder value and the success of Adobe.Participants in the Master Bonus Plan are members of senior management of Adobe who are chosen solely at the discretion of the Committee.Under the Master Bonus Plan, participants will be eligible to receive cash awards based upon the attainment and certification of certain performance goals established by the Committee for the applicable performance period. The performance goals will be determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), unless the Committee determines that a non-GAAP measure can and will be used in a manner that complies with Section 162(m) of the Code.The performance goals may be based on (i) absolute target values, (ii) growth, maintenance or limiting losses, or (iii) values relative to peers or indices, in each case in one or more such categories compared to a prior period, and may differ for each participant. Performance goals may apply to the Company or to one of its business units.The Master Bonus Plan will first apply to fiscal year 2016; however, no payments will be made under the Master Bonus Plan to participants who are “covered employees” (as defined under Section 162(m) of the Code) in respect of performance in fiscal year 2016 if the Master Bonus Plan is not approved by stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Master Bonus Plan will continue until the earlier of (i) the date as of which the Committee terminates the plan and (ii) the last day of the plan fiscal year ending in 2020 unless it is again approved by the Company’s stockholders prior to such day.3The description of the Master Bonus Plan contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Master Bonus Plan, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Master Bonus Plan, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.4 and is incorporated herein by reference. 2016 Executive Annual Incentive PlanOn January 25, 2016, the Committee approved the terms of the 2016 Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), adopted pursuant to the Master Bonus Plan. The Incentive Plan applies to certain executive officers of the Company and is designed to drive revenue growth, encourage accountability, drive execution of short-term priorities tied to long-term strategy and annual operating plan objectives, and recognize and reward the Company’s executives upon the achievement of certain objectives.Executive officers designated by the Company’s Board of Directors as an officer for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, who are Senior Vice President level or above and who are employed by the Company during its 2016 fiscal year are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan.  Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, each participant is eligible to receive an incentive bonus calculated as a percentage of his or her base salary.The Incentive Plan requires that the Company achieve at least 85% of the GAAP revenue target set forth in the annual operating plan for fiscal year 2016 as approved by the Board at the beginning of the fiscal year (the “FY16 Operating Plan”) as a minimum performance threshold before participants may earn any incentive bonus under the Incentive Plan.  If the initial threshold is not achieved, no payments may be made under the Incentive Plan.  If this initial threshold is achieved, each participant is eligible to earn a maximum bonus equal to 200% of such participant’s annual bonus target, up to a maximum of $5 million, subject to reduction as described below.  The target bonus is calculated by multiplying a participant’s base salary in effect at the end of the performance period by a Committee-approved target bonus percentage.For fiscal year 2016, the target bonus and maximum bonus, expressed as a percentage of base salary for the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers*, would be as follows:  *David Wadhwani is no longer with the Company and, as such, is not a participant in the Company's 2016 Executive Annual Incentive Plan. The maximum bonus for each participant is subject to reduction based on the Company’s or the participant’s performance. Fifty percent of a participant’s target award opportunity is tied to the Corporate Performance Result and fifty percent of a participant’s target award opportunity is tied to his or her Individual Performance Result, each as described below. The actual bonus is comprised of:4The “Corporate Performance Result” (expressed as a percentage) is the product of: (1) Financial Performance and (2) Strategic Objectives.  The Company’s financial performance for the Performance Period (“Financial Performance”) is determined by a metric comprised of both (1) net new annualized recurring revenue in Digital Media and (2) bookings for the Adobe Marketing Cloud, in both cases as set forth in the FY16 Operating Plan.As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 27, 2015, we define annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, in our Digital Media business as the sum of Creative ARR and Document Cloud ARR. We define Creative ARR as the sum of: (1) the annual value of Creative Cloud subscriptions and services; plus (2) the annual contract value of Digital Publishing Suite; plus (3) the annual contract value of Creative Enterprise Term License Agreements. We define Document Cloud ARR as the sum of (1) the annual value of Document Cloud subscriptions and services; plus (2) the annual contract value of Document Cloud Enterprise Term License Agreements. The bookings target for Adobe Marketing Cloud is also based on the target set forth in the FY16 Operating Plan. Our bookings measure is a proprietary formula that we use to monitor the value of our business in the Adobe Marketing Cloud.  Financial Performance measures net new ARR in our Digital Media business and Bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud on a combined basis, with the actual percentage of Financial Performance achievement determining the Financial Performance payout percentage (with a maximum achievement of 200%), as shown on Exhibit A of the Incentive Plan. The  Financial Performance is also subject to adjustment by the Committee by up to 20 percentage points up or down based on the Committee’s assessment of the Company’s qualitative performance during the fiscal year (with a maximum achievement of 200%).The Financial Performance payout percentage, after any adjustment as described in the preceding sentence, will cap the Corporate Performance Result.  The Corporate Performance Result may be adjusted downward based on the outcome of Company strategic objectives (“Strategic Objectives”) established by the Committee in consultation with the Board at the outset of the fiscal year.  The percentage achievement of the Strategic Objectives (assessed on a scale of 0% to 100%) is multiplied by the Financial Performance to determine the Corporate Performance Result. The remaining 50% of each participant’s bonus opportunity under the Incentive Plan is based on individual performance including, without limitation, achievement of individual performance goals selected by the Committee at the outset of the performance period, which goals are specifically tailored to each participant and aligned with the achievement of strategic objectives contained in the FY16 Operating Plan (the “Individual Performance Result”).  A participant’s Individual Performance Result may range from 0% to 200%.Once each component described above is certified by the Committee, the actual bonus award earned by each participant under the Incentive Plan is determined using the following formula:Any amounts paid under the Incentive Plan are subject to recoupment from participants in accordance with the Company’s clawback policies.The description of the Incentive Plan contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Incentive Plan, does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Incentive Plan, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.5 and is incorporated herein by reference. 5Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

451,ADBE,up,2015-12-10 16:06:28,"December 10, 2015, Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended November 27, 2015. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles; (D) investment gains and losses; (E) gain on sale of property assets; (F) accrued loss contingencies; (G) income tax adjustments; and (H) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:A.     Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares, stock options and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.B.     Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact. During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. Restructuring and other charges are 2excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. D.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.     Gain on sale of property assets and related tax impact. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we sold land and an unoccupied building located in San Jose, California. We exclude such gains and the related tax impact as they are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.F.                   Accrued loss contingencies associated with one-time litigation events and related tax impact.  In connection with ongoing litigation or similar events, we accrue losses in the event such losses are determined to be both probable and estimable in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20, Loss Contingencies. Upon resolution of the litigation or event, we adjust the accrual to reflect final resolution. From time to time we exclude such losses and the related tax impact when they relate to one-time events that are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.G.     Income Tax Adjustments. Our Income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our long-term non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, reenactment of the Federal Research and Development tax credit and resolution of an income tax audit, are made to help us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate only on an annual basis. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a number of reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. Based on our long-term projections, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 21% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015.H.     Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.3Item 9.01.

A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles; (D) investment gains and losses; (E) income tax adjustments; and (F) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:A.     Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares, stock options and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.B.     Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact. During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.2C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. D.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.     Income tax adjustments. Our Income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our long-term non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, reenactment of the Federal Research and Development tax credit and resolution of an income tax audit, are made to help us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate only on an annual basis. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a number of reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. Based on our long-term projections, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 21% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. F.     Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.3Item 9.01.

457,ADBE,stay,2015-01-28 17:14:39,"January 26, 2015, the Executive Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe” or the “Company”) approved the 2015 Performance Share Program, including the Award Calculation Methodology (the “Program”), under the terms of the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.  The Committee established the Program to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance, and enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain highly talented individuals.  Members of the Company’s executive management team and other key members of senior management were selected by the Committee to participate in the Program for fiscal year 2015.  The Committee granted awards to the executive officers under the Program on January 26, 2015 in the form of a target award and a maximum award of performance shares (“Performance Shares”), approved pursuant to the terms of the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.Under the Program, shares may be earned based on the achievement of objective relative total stockholder return (“TSR”) measured over a three-year performance period (Adobe’s 2015 - 2017 fiscal years).  The Committee will certify actual performance achievement following the Company’s 2017 fiscal year-end and the corresponding number of Performance Shares earned for the three-year performance period, subject to specified change of control exceptions.  In addition, as a condition to earning any Performance Shares, a participant must continue to provide service to Adobe (or an affiliate) through the later of the certification date and January 24, 2018.  Accordingly, the Performance Shares will align our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders over the long term, while also providing key retention incentives.Participants can earn between 0% and 200% (the payout cap under the Program) of his or her target number of Performance Shares.  The amount of Performance Shares actually earned is based on a relative three-year TSR measure, which objectively compares the TSR of Adobe’s common stock against the TSR of the companies included in the NASDAQ 100 Index as of November 29, 2014 (the first day of Adobe’s 2015 fiscal year) during the course of the three-year period.  Generally, TSR will be compared using the 90-calendar day average ending at the beginning of Adobe’s 2015 fiscal year and ending at the end of Adobe’s 2017 fiscal year.  The number of Performance Shares awarded will increase or decrease 2.5% for every percentile that Adobe’s TSR percentile rank is above or below, respectively, the NASDAQ 100 companies’ 50th percentile, and no shares will be awarded if the Company’s performance ranks below the 25th percentile for the three-year performance period. Additionally, regardless of Adobe’s relative position with respect to the NASDAQ 100 companies, the award will be capped at 100% of target in the case of Adobe having a negative absolute TSR over the measurement period. The target awards and maximum awards for the Performance Shares granted to the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers on January 26, 2015 are as set forth below.* For purposes of this filing, the term “named executive officer” refers to executive officers for whom disclosure was required in our most recent filing with the Securities Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that required disclosure pursuant to Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K. 2A participant may receive less than his or her target award, and in no event may actual shares earned exceed the maximum award.  Any shares issued under the Program are subject to recoupment in accordance with the Company’s policy to recoup amounts as required by applicable law. The description of the Program contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Program, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Program used in connection with the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 10.1.  Copies of the 2015 Performance Share Program and the form of Award Grant Notice and Performance Share Award Agreement for use in connection with grants under this Program are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.2015 Executive Annual Incentive PlanOn January 26, 2015, the Committee approved the terms of the 2015 Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), adopted pursuant to the Company’s 2011 Executive Cash Performance Bonus Plan, which applies to certain executive officers of the Company.  The Incentive Plan is designed to drive revenue growth, encourage accountability, drive execution of short-term priorities tied to long-term strategy and annual operating plan objectives, and recognize and reward the Company’s executives upon the achievement of certain objectives.Executive officers designated by the Company’s Board of Directors as an officer for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, who are Senior Vice President level or above and who are employed by the Company during its 2015 fiscal year are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan.  Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, each participant is eligible to receive an incentive bonus calculated as a percentage of his or her earned base salary.The Incentive Plan requires that the Company achieve at least 85% of the GAAP revenue target set forth in the annual operating plan for fiscal year 2015 as approved by the Board at the beginning of the fiscal year (the “FY15 Operating Plan”) as a minimum performance threshold before participants may earn any incentive bonus under the Incentive Plan.  If the initial threshold is not achieved, no payments may be made under the Incentive Plan.  If this initial threshold is achieved, each participant is eligible to earn a maximum bonus equal to 200% of such participant’s annual bonus target, up to a maximum of $5 million, subject to reduction as described below.  The target bonus is calculated by multiplying a participant’s base salary earned during the fiscal year by a Committee-approved target bonus percentage.For fiscal year 2015, the target bonus and maximum bonus, expressed as a percentage of base salary earned for the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers, are as follows:  The maximum bonus for each participant is subject to reduction based on the Company’s or the participant’s achievement of various pre-established goals. Seventy-five percent of a participant’s target award opportunity is tied to the Corporate Result and twenty-five percent of a participant’s target award opportunity is tied to his or her Individual Goals Result, each as described below. 3The actual bonus is comprised of:The “Corporate Result” (expressed as a percentage) is the weighted average of two elements (with the weighting as shown in the formula above): (1) Financial Performance and (2) Customary Advocacy.  The Company’s financial performance for the Performance Period (“Financial Performance”) is determined by a metric comprised of both (1) net new annualized recurring revenue in Digital Media and (2) net bookings for the Adobe Marketing Cloud, in both cases as set forth in the FY15 Operating Plan.As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2014, we define annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, in our Digital Media business as the sum of: (1) the number of current subscriptions, multiplied by the average subscription price paid per user per month, multiplied by twelve months; plus (2) twelve months of contract value of Enterprise Term License Agreements where the revenue is ratably recognized over the life of the contract; plus (3) twelve months of Adobe Digital Publishing Suite contract value where the revenue is ratably recognized.  The net new ARR target under our Incentive Plan is based on the FY15 ARR target set forth for specified products and services in the FY15 Operating Plan, with achievement to be measured as the ARR at the end of fiscal year 2015 less the ARR at the beginning of fiscal year 2015.The Net Bookings target for Adobe Marketing Cloud is also based on the target set forth in the FY15 Operating Plan. Our Net Bookings measure is a proprietary formula that we use to monitor the value of our business in the Adobe Marketing Cloud.  Financial Performance measures net new ARR in our Digital Media business and Net Bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud on a combined basis, with the actual percentage of Financial Performance achievement determining the Financial Performance payout percentage (with a maximum achievement of 200%), as shown on Exhibit A of the Incentive Plan.  The Financial Performance payout percentage is then factored into the Corporate Result calculation.The Customer Advocacy Result is based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the Company’s improvement of the customer experience by achievement of customer advocacy objectives.  If the Financial Performance payout percentage is at or below 100%, then the maximum percentage of the Customer Advocacy Result permitted will be 100%.  If the Financial Performance payout percentage is above 100%, then the maximum percentage of the Customer Advocacy Result permitted will be equal to the Financial Performance payout percentage (with a maximum achievement of 200%).The Corporate Result is also subject to adjustment by the Committee by up to 20 percentage points up or down based on the Committee’s assessment of the Company’s qualitative performance during the fiscal year (with a maximum achievement of 200%).The remaining 25% of each participant’s bonus opportunity under the Incentive Plan is based on the achievement of individual performance goals selected by the Committee at the outset of the performance period, which goals are specifically tailored to each participant and aligned with the achievement of strategic objectives contained in the FY15 Operating Plan (the “Individual Goals Result”).  A participant’s Individual Goals Result may range from 0% to 200%.4Once each component described above is certified by the Committee, the actual bonus award earned by each participant under the Incentive Plan is determined using the following formula:Any amounts paid under the Incentive Plan are subject to recoupment from participants in accordance with the Company’s policy to recoup amounts as required by applicable law.The description of the Incentive Plan contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Incentive Plan, does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Incentive Plan and the 2011 Executive Cash Performance Bonus Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 10.4.

A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (D) investment gains and losses; (E) accrued loss contingencies; (F) income tax adjustments; and (G) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  Through the end of fiscal 2013, we made certain income tax adjustments to our non-GAAP financial measures to reflect the income tax effects of each item we excluded from our pre-tax non-GAAP financial measures, as well as certain discrete one-time income tax adjustments. This approach is consistent with how we evaluate operating performance and plan, forecast and analyze future periods. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we began using a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating operating performance, as well as planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our current long-term projections, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 21% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results in fiscal 2014. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:A.     Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares, stock options and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We 2further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.B.     Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact. During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. Periodically, we also incur charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements.We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the  period incurred.D.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.        Accrued loss contingencies associated with one-time litigation events.  In connection with ongoing litigation or similar events, we accrue losses in the event such losses are determined to be both probable and estimable in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20, Loss Contingencies. From time to time we exclude such losses and the related tax impact when they relate to one-time events that are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.F.     Income Tax Adjustments. Our Income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the 21% long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results effective in fiscal 2014. In arriving at our long-term non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, reenactment of the Federal Research and Development tax credit and resolution of an income tax audit, are made to help us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We intend to evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate only on an annual basis. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a number of reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate.G.     Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.On December 5, 2014, our Executive Compensation Committee approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated 2014 Executive Severance Plan in the Event of a Change of Control (the “Change of Control Plan”), to be effective on December 13, 2014. The 3Change of Control Plan is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.  The Change of Control Plan replaces Adobe’s 2011 Executive Severance Plan in the Event of a Change of Control for Prior Participants and Adobe’s 2011 Executive Severance Plan in the Event of a Change of Control, both of which will terminate in accordance with their terms on December 13, 2014.Effective December 5, 2014, Adobe and Shantanu Narayen entered into a Retention Agreement (the “Amended Retention Agreement”), which amends the original Retention Agreement between Adobe and Mr. Narayen, dated January 12, 1998, as amended February 11, 2008, based on his promotion to Chief Executive Officer and December 11, 2010, in order to clarify the manner of compliance with, or exemption from, Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.  The Amended Retention Agreement clarifies certain matters relating to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A; it does not modify the existing substantive terms and conditions.

463,ADBE,stay,2014-03-18 16:06:14,"March 18, 2014, Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2014. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (D) investment gains and losses; (E) accrued loss contingencies; (F) income tax adjustments; and (G) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  Through the end of fiscal 2013, we made certain income tax adjustments to our non-GAAP financial measures to reflect the income tax effects of each item we excluded from our pre-tax non-GAAP financial measures, as well as certain discrete one-time income tax adjustments. This approach is consistent with how we evaluate operating performance and plan, forecast and analyze future periods. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we began using a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating operating performance, as well as planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our current long-term projections, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 21% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results.As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:A.     Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.2B.     Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact. During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We also incurred charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.D.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.        Accrued loss contingencies associated with one-time litigation events.  In connection with ongoing litigation or similar events, we accrue losses in the event such losses are determined to be both probable and estimable in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20, Loss Contingencies. From time to time we exclude such losses and the related tax impact when they relate to one-time events that are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.F.     Income Tax Adjustments. Our Income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the 21% long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. In arriving at our long-term non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, reenactment of the Federal Research and Development tax credit and resolution of an income tax audit, are made to help us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. G.     Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.3Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.(d) Exhibits99.1 Press release issued on March 18, 2014 entitled “Adobe Reports Strong Q1 FY2014 Results”4SIGNATURES"
464,ADBE,stay,2014-01-29 16:06:24,"January 24, 2014, the Executive Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe” or the “Company”) approved the 2014 Performance Share Program, including the Award Calculation Methodology (the “Program”), under the terms of the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. The Committee established the Program to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance, and enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. Members of the Company’s executive management team and other key members of senior management were selected by the Committee to participate in the Program for fiscal year 2014. The Committee granted awards for the executive officers under the Program on January 24, 2014 in the form of a target award and a maximum award of performance shares (“Performance Shares”) approved pursuant to the terms of the Company’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.Under our Performance Share Program for fiscal year 2014, shares may be earned based on the achievement of objective relative total stockholder return (“TSR”) measured over a three-year performance period (Adobe’s 2014 - 2016 fiscal years). Three years following the date of grant, the Committee will certify the performance results and the number of Performance Shares earned as of the end of the three-year performance period.  All Performance Shares earned will also vest upon the Committee’s certification of performance results, subject to the participant continuing to provide service to Adobe (or an affiliate) on such date. Accordingly, the Performance Shares will both align our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders over the long term, while also providing key retention incentives.The participants can earn between 0% and 200% (the payout cap under the Program) of the target amount of Performance Share awards, and the amount of Performance Shares actually awarded is based on a cumulative three-year TSR measure, which would objectively compare the TSR of Adobe’s common stock against the TSR of the companies included in the NASDAQ 100 Index as of November 30, 2013 (the first day of Adobe’s 2014 fiscal year) during the course of the three-year period. The number of Performance Shares awarded will increase or decrease 2.5% for every percentile that Adobe’s TSR percentile rank is above or below, respectively, the NASDAQ 100 companies’ 50th percentile, and no shares will be awarded if the Company’s performance ranks below the 25th percentile for the three-year performance period. Additionally, regardless of Adobe’s relative position with respect to the NASDAQ 100 companies, the award will be capped at 100% of target in the case of Adobe having a negative absolute TSR over the measurement period.Performance Shares will be earned (if at all) upon certification by the Committee of actual performance achievement following the Company’s 2016 fiscal year-end, subject to specified change of control exceptions. In addition, as a condition to earning any Performance Shares, a participant must be employed by the Company through later of the certification date and the three-year anniversary of the date of grant.The target awards and maximum awards for the Performance Shares granted to the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers* on January 24, 2014 are as set forth below.* For purposes of this filing, the term “named executive officer” refers to executive officers for whom disclosure was required in our most recent filing with the Securities Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that required disclosure pursuant to Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K. Kevin Lynch is no longer with the Company and, as such, is not a participant in the Company’s 2014 Performance Share Program. 2A participant may receive less than his or her target award, and in no event may actual shares earned exceed the maximum award. Any shares issued under the Program are subject to recoupment from participants in accordance with any clawback policy that the Company is required to adopt pursuant to applicable laws. The description of the Program contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Program, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Program used in connection with the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 10.1. Copies of the 2014 Performance Share Program and the form of Award Grant Notice and Performance Share Award Agreement for use in connection with grants under this Program are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.2014 Executive Annual Incentive PlanOn January 24, 2014, the Committee approved the terms of the 2014 Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), adopted pursuant to the Company’s 2011 Executive Cash Performance Bonus Plan, which applies to certain executive officers of the Company. The Incentive Plan is designed to drive revenue growth, encourage accountability, drive execution of short-term priorities tied to long-term strategy and annual operating plan objectives, and recognize and reward the Company’s executives upon the achievement of certain objectives.Executive officers specifically designated by the Board who are employed by the Company during its 2014 fiscal year and are Senior Vice President level or above are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, each participant is eligible to receive an incentive bonus calculated as a percentage of the executive’s earned base salary.The Incentive Plan requires that the Company achieve at least 85% of the GAAP revenue target set forth in the annual operating plan for fiscal year 2014 approved by the Board at the beginning of the fiscal year (the “FY14 Operating Plan”) as a minimum performance threshold before participants may earn any incentive bonus under the Incentive Plan. If the initial threshold is not achieved, no payments are made under the Incentive Plan. If this initial threshold is achieved, each participant is eligible to earn a maximum bonus equal to 200% of such participant’s annual bonus target, up to a maximum of $5 million, subject to reduction as described below. The target bonus is calculated by multiplying a participant’s base salary earned during the fiscal year by a Committee-approved target bonus percentage.For fiscal year 2014, the target bonus and maximum bonus, expressed as a percentage of annual base salary earned for the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers*, are as follows: * Kevin Lynch is no longer with the Company and, as such, is not a participant in the Company’s 2014 Executive Annual Incentive Plan. The maximum bonus for each participant is subject to reduction based on the Company’s or the executive’s achievement of various pre-established goals. Seventy-five percent of an executive’s target award opportunity is tied to the Corporate Result and twenty-five percent of an executive’s target award opportunity is tied to his or her Individual Result, each as described below. 3The actual bonus is comprised of:[Corporate Result]The Corporate Result (expressed as a percentage) is the weighted average of three elements: (1) the Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, Result (weighted at 2x); (2) the Net Bookings Result (weighted at 2x) and (3) the Customary Advocacy Result (weighted at 1x).  The Corporate Result is also subject to adjustment by the Committee by as much as 20 percentage points up or down based on the Committee’s assessment of the Company’s qualitative performance during the fiscal year (with a maximum achievement of 200%).As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 29, 2013, we define annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, in our Digital Media business as the sum of (1) the number of current paid subscriptions, multiplied by the average subscription price paid per user per month, multiplied by twelve months; plus (2) twelve months of contract value of Enterprise Term License Agreements where the revenue is ratably recognized over the life of the contract. The ARR target under our Incentive Plan is based on the ARR target set forth for specified products and services in the FY14 Operating Plan, and the actual percentage achievement of the ARR component moves up or down (with a maximum achievement of 200%) based on the Company’s Digital Media ARR achievement, as shown on Exhibit A of the Incentive Plan.The Net Bookings target for Adobe Marketing Cloud is also based on the target set forth in the FY14 Operating Plan. Our Net Bookings measure is a proprietary formula that we use to monitor the value of our new business in the Adobe Marketing Cloud. As with the ARR component under our Incentive Plan, the actual percentage achievement of the Net Bookings component moves up or down (with a maximum achievement of 200%) based on the Company’s Digital Marketing Net Bookings achievement, as shown on Exhibit B of the Incentive Plan.The Customer Advocacy Result is based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the Company’s improvement of the customer experience by achievement of customer advocacy objectives.  If the average of the ARR Result and Net Bookings Result (equally weighted) is at or below 100%, then the maximum percentage of the Customer Advocacy Result permitted will be 100%.  If the average of the ARR Result and Net Bookings Result (equally weighted) is above 100%, then the maximum percentage of the Customer Advocacy Result permitted will be equal to the average of the ARR Result and Net Bookings Result (equally weighted), up to a maximum achievement of 200%.The remaining 25% of each executive’s bonus opportunity under the Incentive Plan is based on the achievement of individual performance goals selected by the Committee at the outset of the performance period, which goals are specifically tailored to each executive and aligned with the achievement of strategic objectives contained in the FY14 Operating Plan (the “Individual Goals Result”).  An executive’s Individual Goals Result may range from 0% to 200%.Once each component is certified by the Committee as described above, the actual bonus awards earned by each participant under the Incentive Plan are determined using the following formula:Any amounts paid under the Incentive Plan are subject to recoupment from participants in accordance with any clawback policy that the Company is required to adopt pursuant to applicable laws.4The description of the Incentive Plan contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Incentive Plan, does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Incentive Plan and the 2011 Executive Cash Performance Bonus Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 10.4.

465,ADBE,up,2013-12-12 16:07:53,"December 12, 2013, Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended November 29, 2013. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (D) investment gains and losses; (E) resolution of income tax examinations; (F) income tax adjustments; and (G) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  Through the end of fiscal 2013, we made certain income tax adjustments to our non-GAAP financial measures to reflect the income tax effects of each item we excluded from our pre-tax non-GAAP financial measures, as well as certain discrete one-time income tax adjustments. This approach is consistent with how we evaluate operating performance and plan, forecast and analyze future periods. Beginning in fiscal 2014, we will use a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating operating performance, as well as planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our current long-term projections, we intend to use a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 21% which is consistent with our normalized historical fiscal year tax rate during the past four fiscal years. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results.As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:A.     Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our 2financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.B.     Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact. During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. During fiscal 2013 we recorded a write-down associated with certain property assets reclassified as held for sale to their fair value net of estimated costs to sell. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We also incurred charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.D.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.        Resolution of income tax examinations and related tax impact. During the fiscal quarters ended August 30, 2013 and November 29, 2013, we realized a one-time tax benefit and a one-time tax expense, respectively, as a result of the resolution of income tax examinations. We have excluded these items because the tax benefit (expense) is unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.F.     Income Tax Adjustments. Income tax adjustments in fiscal 2013 included one-time tax charges in connection with an acquisition and technology license arrangements and a one-time tax benefit due to the reenactment of the Federal Research and Development tax credit, which was retroactively extended to January 1, 2012. Income tax adjustments in fiscal 2012 included a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition.  We excluded these adjustments because these items are not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.G.     Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.3Item 9.01.

Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results.B.     Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact. During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. During the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we recorded a write-down associated with certain property assets reclassified as held for sale to their fair value net of estimated costs to sell. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased 2technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We also incurred charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.D.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.E.     Income tax adjustments. Other income tax adjustments in the first quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013 include one-time tax charges in connection with an acquisition and technology license arrangements and a one-time tax benefit due to the reenactment of the Federal Research and Development tax credit, which was retroactively reinstated as of January 1, 2012. Other income tax adjustments in the first quarter and first six months of fiscal 2012 include a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition.  We exclude these adjustments because these items are not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.F.     Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.Item 9.01.

469,ADBE,up,2013-03-19 16:02:51,"March 19, 2013, Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 1, 2013. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, and forecasted non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (D) investment gains and losses; (E) income tax adjustments; and (F) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results.As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:A.     Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.

Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.C.     Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for 2accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We also incurred charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.D.     Investment gains and losses and related tax impact.

Other income tax adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 include a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition.

(the “Company”) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing that on December 26, 2014, the Company received notice of a stockholder derivative action on November 24, 2014, on the grounds that in calendar 2014, the Company granted equity awards to the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Lisa Su, in excess of the per calendar year share limit on individual awards under the Company’s 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”).  Rather than litigate this technical issue, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) decided to rescind and void certain performance-based restricted stock unit (“PRSU”) and restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards (collectively, the “Voided Equity Awards”) granted to Dr. Su during 2014.  In disclosing this decision, the Company also disclosed the Board’s intent to replace the Voided Equity Awards with new grants at the earliest practicable opportunity available to the Company, subject to law and the terms of the 2004 Plan.  On February 18, 2015, the Company disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K/A that on February 12, 2015, the Board determined that it was advisable and in the best interest of the Company to grant Dr. Su an award of PRSUs and an award of RSUs in an effort to partially return Dr. Su’s equity compensation to the level it was prior to the action to void and rescind the Voided Equity Awards.At the Company’s 2015 annual meeting of stockholders held on April 29, 2015, the Company sought and received shareholder approval for an amendment to the 2004 Plan to increase the annual share limit on individual awards from 3 million shares to 10 million shares.On May 4, 2015, the Company disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K/A that on April 30, 2015, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the Company to grant Dr. Su an award of PRSUs in order to fully return Dr. Su’s equity compensation to the level it was prior to the action to void and rescind the Voided Equity Awards. The stockholder who filed the stockholder derivative action first challenging the 2014 grants subsequently filed an amended complaint in the same case alleging that the replacement of the Voided Equity Awards in 2015 amounted to an amendment of the 2004 Plan that required a shareholder vote.  The Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim, and in a transcript ruling dated September 16, 2016, the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Court”) agreed with the Company and ruled that the rescission and later replacement of the awards at issue was not an amendment of the 2004 Plan and did not require a shareholder vote.  Accordingly, on March 1, 2017, the Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim.  Notwithstanding that dismissal, the stockholder’s counsel demanded a “mootness” fee to compensate them for the “benefit” they had allegedly conferred on the Company by causing the Company to rescind and replace the Voided Equity Awards.  The Company does not believe the stockholder or her counsel have conferred any benefit on the Company.  However, rather than litigate this issue, the Company agreed to pay the stockholder’s counsel $55,000 in legal fees.  In accordance with the Court’s order approving the resolution of this issue and the final dismissal of the matter, the Company hereby provides notice in the attached Exhibit 99.1.  Item 9.01.

The Company and GF agreed to establish a comprehensive framework for technology collaboration for the 7nm technology node.  The Sixth Amendment also provides the Company a limited waiver with rights to contract with another wafer foundry with respect to certain products in the 14nm and 7nm technology nodes and gives the Company greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across its product portfolio. In consideration for these rights, the Company will pay GF $100 million, which will be paid in installments starting in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 through the third fiscal quarter of 2017.

Further, for each calendar year during the term of the Sixth Amendment, the Company and GF agreed to annual wafer purchase targets that increase from 2016 through 2020.  If the Company does not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any calendar year, the Company will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the Company’s actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year.

The Company and GF also agreed on fixed pricing for wafers purchased during the 2016 year and established a framework to agree on annual wafer pricing for the years 2017 to 2020.

628,APD,down,2016-04-04 09:01:07,"March 29, 2016, the Board of Directors of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the “Company”) determined that the Company will exit its Energy-from-Waste (EfW) business and discontinue efforts to start up and operate its two EfW projects located in Tees Valley, United Kingdom. The decision to exit the business and stop development of the projects was based on continued difficulties encountered in starting up the Tees Valley 1 project; and the Company’s conclusion, based on extended testing and analysis completed during the second fiscal quarter of 2016, that significant additional time and resources would be required to make the Tees Valley projects operational. In addition, the decision allows the Company to execute its strategy of focusing resources on its core Industrial Gases business. It is expected that wind down activities with respect to the Tees Valley projects will cease by the end of calendar year 2016.  As a result of the decision to exit the EfW business, the Company plans to report the EfW segment as a discontinued operation beginning with the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016. The Company estimates that it will record total charges of $950 million —$1.1 billion as losses from discontinued operations. Approximately $900 million to $1.0 billion of this charge is expected to be recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, of which $850 million to $900 million will account for the write down of plant assets to their estimated net realizable value. The remainder of the second quarter charge is attributable to estimated plant disposition and severance costs which are expected to result in future cash expenditures.  Amounts related to these actions are still being finalized. More details will be provided in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016. Additional exit costs may be recorded in future periods to wind down the plant and settle remaining purchase contracts. In addition, the Company is evaluating the disposition of an air separation unit in the Industrial Gases – EMEA segment that was constructed primarily to provide oxygen to one of the Tees Valley plants. The current value of this asset is approximately $60 million.  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 concerning the expected amount and timing of charges and cash expenditures and expected completion of the contemplated actions. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including the risk that the charges or cash expenditures may be in excess of the estimated amounts or may occur in different fiscal periods than expected, the Company’s inability to complete actions to exit the EfW business within the time periods anticipated, and other risk factors, including those described in the Company’s Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.     2        SIGNATURES  "

634,AKAM,up,2018-02-06 17:17:05,"January 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) of Akamai Technologies, Inc. (""Akamai"" or the ""Company"") adopted bonus and equity compensation programs for 2018 for the following individuals (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers):  F. Thomson Leighton, Chief Executive Officer; James Benson, Chief Financial Officer; Robert Blumofe, Executive Vice President - Platform and General Manager Enterprise Division; Rick McConnell, President - General Manager Web Division; and William Wheaton, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer (each, an “Executive” and collectively, the “Executives”).Messrs. Benson, Blumofe, Leighton and McConnell are eligible to participate in a 2018 bonus program that provides for payment to the extent designated corporate performance objectives are met. Amounts earned by Messrs. Benson, Blumofe and McConnell are payable in cash.  Mr. Leighton’s plan provides for payment of any amounts earned in shares of vested common stock issued under the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Plan”), in lieu of cash; the number of shares to be issued, if any, will be calculated by dividing the bonus value achievement by the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock on the date that financial results for 2018 are certified by the Committee (the “2018 Certification Date”). For each of the Executives, the performance objectives consist of and are weighted as follows: 50% based on Akamai’s achievement of a specified revenue target for fiscal year 2018 and 50% based on Akamai’s achievement of a specified adjusted operating income target for fiscal year 2018. Calculation of performance against the revenue and adjusted operating income targets will take into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Mr. Wheaton is not eligible to receive an annual bonus payment; however, the Committee adopted a resolution stating that, notwithstanding such fact, solely for purposes of Section 5(b) of the Akamai Technologies, Inc. Executive Severance Pay Plan as in effect on January 31, 2018 and Section 4(a)(iv) of Mr. Wheaton’s Change in Control and Severance Agreement, Mr. Wheaton’s “annual incentive bonus at target” shall mean 80% of his 2018 base salary.  For Mr. Leighton, his 2018 base salary will be $1.00, with a target bonus value of $1,000,000 and maximum value of $2,000,000. For Mr. Benson, his 2018 base salary will be $500,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 85% of his 2018 base salary and a maximum cash bonus equal to 170% of his 2018 base salary. For Mr. Blumofe, his 2018 base salary will be $490,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 80% of his 2018 base salary and a maximum cash bonus equal to 160% of his 2018 base salary. For Mr. McConnell, his 2018 base salary will be $565,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 100% of his 2018 base salary and a maximum cash bonus equal to 200% of his 2018 base salary.  Mr. Wheaton’s 2018 base salary will be $420,000. New salaries become effective July 1, 2018.As described in the table below, the Committee also approved grants to each Executive of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the Plan, consisting of annual vesting RSUs, corporate performance-based vesting RSUs and stock performance-based vesting RSUs as follows:     All RSUs will be granted on the second day following the Company’s release of financial results for fiscal year 2017; the date of grant is expected to be February 8, 2018.  The number of RSUs to be issued will be calculated by dividing the dollar value set forth above by the closing sale price of one share of the Company’s common stock on the grant date (in the case of performance-based RSUs the number shall be based off of the maximum deliverable).  Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Akamai common stock upon vesting.RSUs with annual vesting vest as follows:  1/3 on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.Vesting of corporate performance-based RSUs is subject to the Company’s performance against equally weighted revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share targets over fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, taking into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  The Committee will establish annual revenue and earnings per share goals at the beginning of each of fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020; each year’s performance will be equally weighted in determining the aggregate number of RSUs earned.  Performance at 100% of target will earn the target number of RSUs.  Eligible vesting commences if the Company exceeds 90% of the target; 110% performance against target will earn the maximum number of RSUs issuable. Performance between such levels will be proportionately awarded on a straight-line interpolation. Earned RSUs will vest on the date that the Company’s fiscal 2020 financial results are certified.Vesting of stock performance-based RSUs is based on the total shareholder return (“TSR”) of the Company’s common stock relative to companies in the S&P 500 Information Technology Index (the “Index Group”) over calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020 (the “Performance Period”). TSR will be calculated as the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the last 90 trading days of 2020 plus the aggregate value of dividends per share issued by the Company during the Performance Period minus the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the 90 trading days prior to January 1, 2018 dividing by the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the 90 trading days prior to January 1, 2018.  If the Company’s TSR over the Performance Period is at the 50th percentile when ranked against the TSRs of companies in the Index Group, 100% of the target number of RSUs will be eligible to vest. For every percentile by which the Company’s TSR ranking within the Index Group exceeds the 50th percentile, the number of RSUs eligible to vest will increase by 3.33% of target, up to a maximum of 200% of target if the Company’s TSR ranking is at the 80th percentile.  For every percentile by which the Company’s TSR ranking within the Index Group is below the 50th percentile, the number of RSUs eligible to vest will decrease by 3%, with no payout if the Company’s TSR ranking is below the 25th percentile.  Earned RSUs will vest on the date that the Company’s fiscal 2020 financial results are certified.The form of time-based vesting RSU Agreement was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on August 9, 2013, and the form of performance-based vesting RSU Agreement was previously filed with the Commission on February 6, 2015.The Committee and Mr. Leighton also agreed that his 2017 annual bonus would be paid in vested stock in lieu of cash.SIGNATURE"

641,AKAM,stay,2017-02-03 16:24:00,"February 1, 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Akamai Technologies, Inc. (""Akamai"" or the ""Company"") adopted cash and equity compensation programs for 2017 for the following individuals (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers):  F. Thomson Leighton, Chief Executive Officer; James Benson, Chief Financial Officer; Robert Blumofe, Executive Vice President - Platform and General Manager Enterprise & Carrier; and Rick McConnell, President - General Manager Web Division (each, an “Executive” and collectively, the “Executives”).The cash incentive components of the 2017 compensation program provide for an annual base salary and a cash bonus, the amount of such bonus to be determined based upon the achievement against designated corporate performance objectives.  Each Executive’s cash bonus is weighted as follows: 50% based on Akamai’s achievement of a specified revenue target for fiscal year 2017 and 50% based on Akamai’s achievement of a specified adjusted operating income target for fiscal year 2017. Calculation of performance against the revenue and adjusted operating income targets will take into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  For Dr. Leighton, his base salary will be $1.00, with a target cash bonus equal to $1 million and a maximum cash bonus equal to $2 million.  For Mr. Benson, his base salary will be $480,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 85% of his 2017 salary and a maximum cash bonus equal to 170% of his 2017 salary. For Mr. Blumofe,  his base salary will be $475,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 80% of his 2017 salary and a maximum cash bonus equal to 160% of his 2017 salary. For Mr. McConnell, his base salary will be $550,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 100% of his 2017 salary and a maximum cash bonus equal to 200% of his 2017 salary.  New salaries become effective April 1, 2017.As described in the table below, the Compensation Committee also approved grants to each Executive of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), consisting of annual vesting RSUs, corporate performance-based vesting RSUs and stock performance-based vesting RSUs, in each case issuable pursuant to the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, as follows:     The RSUs will be granted on the second day following the Company’s release of financial results for fiscal year 2016; the date of grant is expected to be February 9, 2017.  The number of RSUs to be issued will be calculated by dividing the dollar value set forth above by the closing sale price of one share of the Company’s common stock on the grant date (in the case of performance-based RSUs the number shall be based off of the maximum deliverable).  Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Akamai common stock upon vesting.RSUs with annual vesting vest as follows:  1/3 on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.Vesting of corporate performance-based RSUs is subject to the Company’s performance against equally weighted revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share targets over fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, taking into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  The Compensation Committee will establish annual revenue and earnings per share goals at the beginning of each of fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019; each year’s performance is equally weighted in determining the aggregate number of RSUs earned.  Performance at 100% of target earns the target number of RSUs.  Eligible vesting commences if the Company exceeds 90% of the target; 110% performance against target merits earning the maximum number of RSUs issuable. Performance between such levels will be proportionately awarded on a straight-line interpolation. Earned RSUs will vest on the date that the Company’s fiscal 2019 financial results are certified.Vesting of stock performance-based RSUs is based on the total shareholder return (“TSR”) of the Company’s common stock relative to companies in the S&P 500 Information Technology Index (the “Index Group”) over calendar years 2017, 2018 and 2019. TSR will be calculated as the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the last 90 trading days of 2019 plus the aggregate value of dividends per share issued by the Company during the 2017-2019 period minus the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the 90 trading days prior to January 1, 2017 dividing by the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the 90 trading days prior to January 1, 2017.  If the Company’s TSR over the Performance Period is at the 50th percentile when ranked against the TSRs of companies in the Index Group, 100% of the target number of RSUs will be eligible to vest. For every percentile by which the Company’s TSR ranking within the Index Group exceeds the 50th percentile, the number of RSUs eligible to vest will increase by 3.33% of target, up to a maximum of 200% of target if the Company’s TSR ranking is at the 80th percentile.  For every percentile by which the Company’s TSR ranking within the Index Group is below the 50th percentile, the number of RSUs eligible to vest will decrease by 3%, with no payout if the Company’s TSR ranking is below the 25th percentile.  Earned RSUs will vest on the date that the Company’s fiscal 2019 financial results are certified. The form of time-based vesting RSU agreement was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on August 9, 2013, and the form of performance-based vesting RSU Agreement was previously filed with the Commission on February 6, 2015.

It is anticipated that all of such individuals will enter into a CIC Agreement with the Company to replace existing agreements terminated by the Company effective in December 2015..The CIC Agreement has been amended to eliminate “single trigger” vesting for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with performance-based vesting conditions granted after November 12, 2015 unless such RSUs are not assumed by the acquirer. As provided in the newly-adopted form of performance RSU agreement approved by the Compensation Committee (the “RSU Agreement”), upon the occurrence of an Acquisition Event (as defined in the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended), RSUs with performance-based vesting conditions assumed by an acquiring or succeeding entity will convert into time-based vesting RSUs on the same vesting schedule but without reference to any performance-based conditions (a “Replacement Award”).  Under the provisions of the CIC Agreement, in the event that the executive’s employment is subsequently terminated by the acquiring or succeeding entity for a reason other than Cause (as defined in the CIC Agreement) or by the executive for Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Agreement), in either case within twelve months after a Change in Control Event (as defined in the CIC Agreement), all of the remaining unvested portion of the Replacement Award will become vested as of the date of the executive’s termination of employment.The CIC Agreement has also been amended to provide that, in the event that the executive’s employment is terminated by the acquiring or succeeding entity for a reason other than Cause or by the employee for Good Reason, in either case within twelve months after a Change in Control Event, he or she will be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the annual incentive bonus at target that would have been payable to the executive under the Company’s Executive Bonus Plan in effect immediately before the Change in Control Event pro-rated based on the date on which the Change in Control Event occurred.The foregoing descriptions of the CIC Agreement and the RSU Agreement are qualified in their entirety by the full text of the CIC Agreement and the RSU Agreement, respectively, set forth in Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

Thomson Leighton, Chief Executive Officer; James Benson, Chief Financial Officer; Melanie Haratunian, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Robert Hughes, President - Worldwide Operations; and Rick McConnell, President - Products & Development (each, an “Executive” and collectively, the “Executives”).The cash incentive components of the 2015 compensation program provide for an annual base salary and a cash bonus, the amount of such bonus to be determined based upon the achievement of certain pre-determined individual and corporate performance objectives.  Each Executive’s cash bonus is weighted as follows: 40% based on Akamai’s achievement of a specified revenue target for fiscal year 2015; 40% based on Akamai’s achievement of a specified non-GAAP operating income target for fiscal year 2015; and 20% based on achievement of individual or departmental performance goals. Calculation of performance against the revenue and non-GAAP operating income targets will take into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  The new base salary will take effect on April 1, 2015.  Below we use the term “2015 base salary earnings” to refer to the aggregate amount of base salary paid to an Executive during the 2015 calendar year.For Dr. Leighton, his base salary will be $1.00, with a target cash bonus equal to 100% of his 2015 base salary earnings.  For Mr. Benson, his new base salary will be $450,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 85% of his 2015 base salary earnings and a maximum cash bonus equal to 153% of his 2015 base salary earnings.

As described in the table below, the Compensation Committee also approved grants to each Executive of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), consisting of both annual vesting RSUs and performance-vesting RSUs, in each case issuable pursuant to the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan as follows:       The RSUs are expected to have an effective grant date of the second day following the Company’s release of financial results for fiscal year 2014, which is anticipated to be February 12, 2015.  The number of RSUs to be issued will be calculated by dividing the dollar value set forth above by the closing sale price of one share of the Company’s common stock on the effective grant date (in the case of performance-based RSUs the number shall be based off of the maximum deliverable).  Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Akamai common stock upon vesting.  RSUs with annual vesting vest as follows:  1/3 on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.  Vesting of performance-vested RSUs is subject to the Company’s performance against the following two-year financial performance targets for 2015-2016 that have been established by the Compensation Committee (weighted as indicated by the associated percentage figures):  Calculation of performance against revenue and operating free cash flow targets will take into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For Category 2 revenue and operating free cash flow, 90% achievement against target merits earning of 12.5% of the maximum number of RSUs issuable; 100% achievement against target merits earning 50% of the maximum issuable number of RSUs issuable; and 110% achievement against target merits earning the maximum number of performance-vested RSUs issuable. For Category 1 revenue, 93% achievement against target merits earning of 12.5% of the maximum number of RSUs issuable; 100% achievement against target merits earning 50% of the maximum issuable number of RSUs issuable; and 107% achievement against target merits earning the maximum number of performance-vested RSUs issuable. Incremental amounts of RSUs become issuable for percentage achievement that falls between the milestone levels identified above. To the extent performance-vested RSUs become issuable, they will vest in two equal 50% installments on the second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.  No RSUs will be issued with respect to a milestone if performance with respect to such milestone is below the threshold amount specified above.On February 4, 2015, the Compensation Committee also adopted a new form of grant agreement for performance-based RSUs that provides for the vesting of a specified number of RSUs following a grantee's departure from the Company (other than in a case of termination for cause) based on the age and tenure of the employee and the date of termination relative to the performance period of the applicable performance-based RSUs.  A copy of the new form of agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1The foregoing description of the RSUs is qualified by the text of the time-based RSU agreements, the form of which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 9, 2013, and the performance-based RSU Agreement, the form of which is filed herewith.

662,AKAM,stay,2014-02-24 16:27:42,"February 18, 2014, Akamai Technologies, Inc. (the “Company” or “Akamai”) completed its acquisition of Prolexic Technologies, Inc.

The acquisition of Prolexic was accomplished through the merger of the Sub with and into Prolexic (the “Merger”).  In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Prolexic survived the Merger as the surviving corporation and, as the surviving corporation, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.On February 18, 2014, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger (the “Closing”), the Company paid to the holders of Prolexic’s capital stock and the holders of vested warrants and options to purchase shares of Prolexic capital stock (collectively, the “Equityholders”) an aggregate of approximately $337.1 million in cash.  The amount paid to the Equityholders at the Closing is subject to a post-closing purchase price adjustment process with respect to the net amount of cash, unpaid transaction expenses, working capital and specified other debt and liabilities of Prolexic at Closing. Akamai also assumed all unvested options to purchase shares of Prolexic capital stock; such options have been converted into options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock based on a conversion ratio calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement.  The Company deposited $50.4 million in cash into an escrow fund for the purposes of securing the indemnification obligations of the Equityholders to the Company for any and all losses for which the Company is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the Merger Agreement and to provide the source of recovery for any amounts payable to the Company as a result of the post-closing purchase price adjustment process.The foregoing descriptions of the Merger and the Merger Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of the Original Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 2, 2013 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the First Amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated by herein by reference.

Thomson Leighton, Chief Executive Officer; James Benson, Chief Financial Officer; Melanie Haratunian, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Robert Hughes, President - Worldwide Operations; and Rick McConnell, President - Products & Development (each, an “Executive” and collectively, the “Executives”).The cash incentive components of the 2014 compensation program provide for an annual base salary and a cash bonus, the amount of such bonus to be determined based upon the achievement of certain pre-determined individual and corporate performance objectives.  Each Executive’s cash bonus is weighted as follows: 40% based on Akamai’s achievement of a specified revenue target for fiscal year 2014; 40% based on Akamai’s achievement of a specified non-GAAP operating income target for fiscal year 2014; and 20% based on achievement of individual or departmental performance goals. Calculation of performance against the revenue and non-GAAP operating income targets will take into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  The new base salary will take effect on April 1, 2014.  Below we use the term “2014 base salary earnings” to refer to the aggregate amount of base salary paid to an Executive during the 2014 calendar year.For Dr. Leighton, his base salary will be $1.00, with a target cash bonus equal to 100% of his 2014 base salary earnings.  For Mr. Benson, his new base salary will be $425,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 75% of his 2014 base salary earnings and a maximum cash bonus equal to135% of his 2014 base salary earnings. For Ms. Haratunian, her new base salary will be $415,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 75% of her 2014 base salary earnings and a maximum cash bonus equal to 135% of her 2014 base salary earnings. For Mr. Hughes, his new base salary will be $515,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 100% of his 2014 base salary earnings and a maximum cash bonus equal to 180% of his 2014 base salary earnings. For Mr. McConnell, his new base salary will be $515,000, with a target cash bonus equal to 100% of his 2014 base salary earnings and a maximum cash bonus equal to 180% of his 2014 base salary earnings.      As described in the table below, the Compensation Committee also approved grants to each Executive of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), in each case issuable pursuant to the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan as follows:       The RSUs will have an effective grant date of the second day following the Company’s release of financial results for fiscal year 2013; the effective date is expected to be February 7, 2014.  The number of RSUs to be issued will be calculated by dividing the dollar value set forth above by the closing sale price of one share of the Company’s common stock on the effective grant date.  Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Akamai common stock upon vesting.  RSUs with annual vesting vest as follows:  1/3 on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.  Vesting of performance-vested RSUs is subject to the Company’s performance against the following two-year financial performance targets for 2014-2015 that have been established by the Compensation Committee (weighted as indicated by the associated percentage figures):  Calculation of performance against revenue and operating free cash flow targets will take into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For each metric, 90% achievement against target merits earning of 12.5% of the maximum number of RSUs issuable; 100% achievement against target merits earning 50% of the maximum issuable number of RSUs issuable; and 110% achievement against target merits earning the maximum number of performance-vested RSUs issuable. Incremental amounts of RSUs become issuable for percentage achievement that falls between the milestone levels identified above. To the extent performance-vested RSUs become issuable, they will vest in two equal 50% installments on the second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.

698,ALB,stay,2018-03-01 16:50:52,"February 23, 2018, each of the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors (together, the “Board”) of Albemarle Corporation (the “Company”) took the following compensation actions. 2018 Base Salaries The Board established the following base salaries for our executive officers for fiscal year 2018: Luther C. Kissam, IV ($1,000,000); Scott A. Tozier ($588,000); Karen G. Narwold ($509,250);  Donald J. LaBauve, Jr. ($304,000); and Matthew K. Juneau ($427,000).  Mr. Juneau is expected to retire in March 2018 and his salary is unchanged from 2017. 2018 Annual Incentive Plan The Board approved the fiscal year 2018 annual incentive plan target award percentages for the executive officers of the Company, pursuant to the Albemarle Corporation 2017 Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”). Under the Incentive Plan, each of these executive officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of zero to two times a target percentage of their respective base salaries if certain company-wide criteria established by the Board are met for 2018. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Mr. Kissam, (125%); Mr. Tozier (75%); Ms. Narwold (75%); Mr. Juneau (75%); and Mr. LaBauve (40%).  However, as a result of Mr. Juneau's expected retirement in March 2018, he is not expected to receive a pay-out for his 2018 annual incentive award opportunity.  For superior corporate performance and subject to the achievement of specific individual performance goals, up to two times the target amount may be earned. The maximum award opportunities for 2018 are as follows: Mr. Kissam ($2,500,000); Mr. Tozier ($882,000); Ms. Narwold ($763,875); Mr. Juneau ($640,500) and Mr. LaBauve ($243,200).  In 2018, if the Executive Compensation Committee certifies that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization exceed 5% of net sales, the awards will initially be determined at maximum. The annual incentive awards actually paid to these executive officers are then adjusted to a level at or below the plan maximum in accordance with the actual Company performance, individual performance, and award targets described above. The Board bases the annual incentive awards for named executive officers on performance measures allowed by the Incentive Plan and uses its negative discretion to pay incentive awards for the executives at the performance level achieved against the goals. Any incentive payments earned under the Incentive Plan for 2018 will be paid in the first quarter of 2019. 2018 Long Term Incentive Grant The Board approved, with a grant date of February 23, 2018, a total grant value of up to $30 million for the 2018 long term incentive plan, consisting of: (i) Stock Options, which will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, and which will expire February 23, 2028; (ii) Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”), one-half of which will vest on February 23, 2021 with the remaining half vesting on February 23, 2022; and (iii) Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”), one-half of which will vest in early 2021 at the time of determination that the Company’s total shareholder return (“Total Shareholder Return”) relative to its peers meets the Company’s related performance goals and one-half on January 1, 2022. Total Shareholder Return is calculated by dividing (a) the sum of the dividends paid during the performance period and the difference between the twenty-day average daily closing price of the Company’s shares at the end and the beginning of the measurement period, by (b) the twenty-day average daily closing price of the Company’s common shares at the beginning of the performance period. The Company’s Total Shareholder Return for the 2018 grants is compared to the Total Shareholder Return of the Company’s peer group of 17 similarly-sized (in terms of revenue) chemical companies (the “Peer Group”). The threshold performance level for the PSUs (25% pay-out) is at the 25th percentile of the Peer Group and the target performance level for the PSUs (100% pay-out) is at the 50th percentile of the Peer Group. The superior performance level begins at the 75th percentile of the Peer Group results and results in a 200% pay-out.  Awards for performance between the specified performance levels will be interpolated. Each of the grants listed above are subject to the terms set forth in the Notice of Option Grant, Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award and Notice of TSR Performance Unit Award. The values of the equity granted to each executive officer are set forth below, and are apportioned 25% in the form of Stock Options, 25% in the form of RSUs and 50% in the form of PSUs, except that Mr. LaBauve received 50% in the form of RSUs and 50% in the form of PSUs: Mr. Kissam ($4,000,000); Mr. Tozier ($1,050,000); Ms. Narwold ($1,000,000) and Mr. LaBauve ($150,000).  Mr. Juneau did not receive an equity grant for 2018. The value of PSUs included in the above figures reflects the approximate number of PSUs that each named executive officer would receive for target level performance by the Company multiplied by the grant date closing stock price.

Under the Incentive Plan, each of these executive officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of zero to two times a target percentage of their respective base salaries if certain company-wide criteria established by the Board are met for 2017. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Mr. Kissam, (125%); Mr. Tozier (75%); Ms. Narwold (75%); Mr. Juneau (75%); and Mr. LaBauve (40%). These executive officers earn these targeted percentages for achieving target performance levels under the Incentive Plan company-wide criteria.

Kissam, IV ($882,000); Scott A. Tozier ($505,000); Karen G. Narwold ($460,000); Matthew K. Juneau ($415,000); and Susan M. Kelliher ($395,000).  2016 Annual Incentive Plan  On February 26, 2016, the Board approved the fiscal year 2016 annual incentive plan target award percentages for certain executive officers of the Company, pursuant to the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan (as amended, the “Incentive Plan”). Under the Incentive Plan, each of these executive officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of zero to two times a target percentage of their respective base salaries if certain company-wide criteria established by the Board are met for 2016. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Luther C. Kissam, IV (125%); Scott A. Tozier (75%); Karen G. Narwold (75%); Matthew K. Juneau (75%) and Susan M. Kelliher (75%). These executive officers earn these targeted percentages for achieving target performance levels under the Incentive Plan company-wide criteria. For superior corporate performance and subject to the achievement of specific individual performance goals, up to two times target may be earned. The maximum amounts payable for 2016 are as follows: Luther C. Kissam, IV ($2,205,000); Scott A. Tozier ($757,500); Karen G. Narwold ($690,000); Matthew K. Juneau ($622,500); and Susan M. Kelliher ($592,500). In order to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in 2016, if earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization exceeds 5% of net sales, the awards are initially determined at maximum. The annual incentive awards actually paid to these executive officers are then adjusted to a level below the plan maximum in accordance with the actual Company performance, individual performance, and award targets described above. The Board bases the annual incentive awards for named executive officers on performance measures allowed by the Incentive Plan and uses its negative discretion to pay incentive awards for the executives at the performance level achieved against the goals. Any incentive payments earned under the Incentive Plan for 2016 will be paid in the first quarter of 2017.  2016 Long Term Incentive Grant  On February 26, 2016, the Board approved a total grant value of up to $30 million for the 2016 long term incentive plan, comprised of: (i) Stock Options, which will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, and which will expire February 25, 2026; (ii) Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”), one-half of which will vest on February 26, 2019 with the remaining half vesting on February 26, 2020; and (iii) Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”), one-half of which will vest in early 2019 at the time of determination that the Company’s total shareholder return (“Total Shareholder Return”) relative to its peers meets the Company’s related performance goals and one-half on January 1, 2020.  Total Shareholder Return is calculated by dividing (a) the sum of the dividends paid during the performance period and the difference between the twenty-day average daily closing price of the Company’s shares at the end and the beginning of the measurement period, by (b) the twenty-day average daily closing price of the Company’s common shares at the beginning of the performance period. The Company’s Total Shareholder Return is compared to the Total Shareholder Return of the Company’s peer group of 18 similarly-sized (in terms of revenue) chemical companies within the Dow Jones Chemical Index (the “Peer Group”) calculated on the same basis. The threshold performance level for the PSUs is at the 25th percentile of the Peer Group and the target performance level for the PSUs is the 50th percentile of the Peer Group. Superior performance level begins at the 75th percentile of the Peer Group results. Awards for performance between the specified performance levels will be interpolated.  Each of the grants listed above will be awarded to certain employees of the Company, and are subject to the terms set forth in the Notice of Option Grant (Exhibit 10.1), Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award (Exhibit 10.2) and Notice of TSR Performance Unit Award (Exhibit 10.3), all of which are incorporated by reference herein.     2.        As part of the grants on February 26, 2016, the Board granted Stock Options, RSUs and PSUs to the Company’s named executive officers for 2016 under the Incentive Plan. The values granted to each executive officer are set forth below, and are apportioned approximately 25% in the form of Stock Options, 25% in the form of RSUs and 50% in the form of PSUs, respectively: Luther C. Kissam IV ($4,000,000); Scott A Tozier ($900,000); Karen G. Narwold ($700,000); Matthew K. Juneau ($600,000); and Susan M. Kelliher ($500,000). The value of PSUs included in the above figures reflects the approximate number of PSUs that each named executive officer would receive for target level performance by the Company multiplied by the grant date closing stock price.

Kissam, IV ($840,000); Scott A. Tozier ($505,000); D. Michael Wilson ($470,000); Karen G. Narwold ($440,000); Matthew K. Juneau ($400,000); and Susan M. Kelliher ($395,000).     2015 Annual Incentive Plan     On February 24, 2015, the Committee approved the 2015 annual incentive plan target award percentages for certain executive officers of the Company, pursuant to the Albemarle Corporation 2008 Incentive Plan (as amended, the “Incentive Plan”). Under the Incentive Plan, each of these executive officers is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment of zero to three times a target percentage of their respective base salaries if certain company-wide criteria established by the Committee are met for 2015. The target percentages of base salary are as follows: Luther C. Kissam, IV (120%); Scott A. Tozier (75%); D. Michael Wilson (75%); Karen G. Narwold (70%); Matthew K. Juneau (70%) and Susan M. Kelliher (70%). These executive officers earn these targeted percentages for achieving target performance levels under the Incentive Plan company-wide criteria. For superior corporate performance, up to two times target may be earned. Further, based on specific individual performance goals, an additional amount may be earned up to the set maximum potential bonus.  The maximum amounts payable for 2015 are as follows: Luther C. Kissam, IV ($3,024,000); Scott A. Tozier ($1,137,000); D. Michael Wilson ($1,059,000); Karen G. Narwold ($924,000); Matthew K. Juneau ($840,000); and Susan M. Kelliher ($831,000). In order to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in 2015, if earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization exceeds 5% of net sales, the awards are initially determined at maximum. The annual incentive awards actually paid to these executive officers are then adjusted to a level below the plan maximum in accordance with the actual Company performance, individual performance, and award targets described above. The Committee bases the annual incentive awards for named executive officers on performance measures allowed by the Incentive Plan and uses its negative discretion to pay incentive awards for the executives at the performance level achieved against the goals. Any incentive payments earned under the Incentive Plan for 2015 will be paid in the first quarter of 2016.     2015 Long Term Incentive Grant     On February 24, 2015, the Committee approved a total grant value of up to $24 million for the 2015 long term incentive plan, comprised of: (i) Stock Options, which will vest in three equal installments over three years beginning on February 24, 2018, and which will expire February 23, 2025; and (ii) Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”) vesting in early 2018 based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“Total Shareholder Return”) relative to its peers.     Total Shareholder Return is calculated by dividing (a) the sum of the dividends paid during the performance period and the difference between the twenty-day average daily closing price of the Company’s shares at the end and the beginning of the measurement period, by (b) the                                           twenty-day average daily closing price of the Company’s common shares at the beginning of the performance period.  The Company’s Total Shareholder Return is compared to the Total Shareholder Return of the Company’s peer group of companies in the Dow Jones Chemical Index (the “Peer Group”) calculated on the same basis.  The threshold performance level for the PSUs is at the 25th percentile of the Peer Group and the target performance level for the PSUs is the 50th percentile of the Peer Group.  Superior performance level begins at the 75th percentile of the Peer Group results. Awards for performance between the specified performance levels will be interpolated.     Each of the grants listed above will be awarded to certain employees of the Company, and are subject to the terms set forth in the Notice of Option Grant (Exhibit 10.1) and Notice of TSR Performance Unit Award (Exhibit 10.2), all of which are incorporated by reference herein.     As part of the grants on February 24, 2015, the Committee granted Stock Options and PSUs to the Company’s named executive officers for 2015 under the Incentive Plan.  The values granted to each executive officer are set forth below, and are apportioned approximately 40% in the form of Stock Options and 60% in the form of PSUs, respectively: Luther C. Kissam IV ($4,000,000); Scott A Tozier ($900,000); D. Michael Wilson ($800,000); Karen G. Narwold ($700,000); Matthew K. Juneau ($600,000); and Susan M. Kelliher ($500,000).  The value of PSUs included in the above figures reflects the approximate number of PSUs that each named executive officer would receive for target level performance by the Company multiplied by the grant date closing stock price.

Other Events.   Recent Developments   Pending and Recent Property Acquisitions   Pending Acquisition of 303 Binney Street   In January 2017, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to acquire a building and three land parcels in the East Cambridge submarket of Greater Boston for a purchase price of $80.3 million.  We expect to complete the acquisition in March 2017 and lease the property back to the seller on a short-term basis. The property is currently entitled for the development of 163,399 square feet for office or office/laboratory use and the potential development of 45,626 square feet for residential use.  We expect to seek additional entitlements for office or office/laboratory use.   Pending Acquisition of Future Ground-up Development Site in San Francisco   In March 2017, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire a future ground-up development site ranging from 10.0 to 12.0 acres in our Greater Stanford submarket of San Francisco for a purchase price of $61.0 million. We expect to pursue aggregate entitlements ranging from 400,000 to 600,000 RSF for a multi-building development. We anticipate leasing the existing property back to the seller on a short-term basis until we obtain entitlements.   Acquisition of 88 Bluxome Street   In January 2017, we acquired land parcels aggregating 2.6 acres at 88 Bluxome Street in our Mission Bay/SoMa submarket of San Francisco for a purchase price of $130.0 million. We are currently obtaining entitlements for the development of this site and anticipate an aggregate of 1.1 million RSF to be available for construction of two buildings in separate phases. We have leased the property back to the seller until we obtain entitlements.   Acquisition of 49% Interest in 1455 and 1515 Third Street Real Estate Joint Venture   In November 2016, we acquired the remaining 49% interest in our real estate joint venture with Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”) for $90.1 million. The real estate joint venture owned land parcels located at 1455 and 1515 Third Street and a parking garage structure in our Mission Bay/SoMa submarket of San Francisco. In connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in the land and parking garage, we leased these assets to Uber for 75 years, beginning in November 2016.

Takeda holds investment-grade ratings of A1 (Moody’s) and A+ (S&P). If the acquisition had been completed as of December 31, 2016, 53% of our annual revenue would have been from investment-grade tenants and 81% of our annual rental revenue from our top 20 tenants would have been from investment-grade tenants.

These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.   The Indenture also provides for customary events of default.  In the case of an event of default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.  If any other event of default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Shigenaga (the Company’s Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer), Stephen A. Richardson (the Company’s Chief Operating Officer and Regional Market Director (San Francisco)), Peter M. Moglia (the Company’s Chief Investment Officer) and Thomas J. Andrews (the Company’s Executive Vice President – Regional Market Director (Greater Boston)) (the “Executives”).  The Agreements amend and restate in their entirety the prior employment agreements between the Company and each of Messrs. Shigenaga, Richardson, Moglia and Andrews, which were effective as of January 1, 2011 or, in the case of Mr. Richardson, October 25, 2011 (the “Prior Employment Agreements”).  The principal purpose of the amendments is to replace “single-trigger” vesting acceleration with “double-trigger” vesting acceleration with respect to equity awards granted on or after January 1, 2016 (the “Effective Date”).  As a result of the amendments, under the Agreements equity awards granted to an Executive on or after the Effective Date do not automatically become fully vested (and exercisable, if applicable) upon a change of control of the Company, but rather only if upon or within two years of such change of control, the Company terminates the Executive’s employment without cause or the Executive terminates his employment for good reason.The Agreements continue to provide that the Executives are employed at-will, with the term of each of the Agreements beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on the date that the Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement.  The Agreements provide that each Executive’s base salary shall be $495,000 and increased annually by no less than a cost-of-living adjustment based on the consumer price index for the city of residence for the applicable Executive.  Each of the Executives will continue to be eligible for an annual bonus and periodic equity awards.Agreement terms which are the same as the Prior Employment AgreementsEach of the Agreements continues to provide that if the applicable Executive’s employment terminates without cause or the Executive resigns for good reason not in connection with a change in control of the Company, the Executive is entitled to receive severance generally equal to one year of the Executive’s base salary and a cash incentive bonus equal to the cash incentive bonus the Executive earned for the previous year (or the year prior to the previous year if the cash incentive bonus for the previous year has not been determined prior to termination).  Each of the Agreements further continues to provide that if, upon or within two years following a change in control of the Company, the Company terminates the Agreement without cause or the Executive terminates the Agreement for good reason, the Executive is entitled to receive severance generally equal to a multiple of his base salary and a cash incentive bonus equal to a multiple of the cash incentive bonus amount he earned for the previous year (or the year prior to the previous year if the cash incentive bonus for the previous year has not been determined prior to termination).  The multiple for Messrs. Shigenaga, Richardson, and Andrews is 2.0x and the multiple for Mr. Moglia is 1.5x.  In any of the foregoing cases, all of the Executive’s unvested shares of restricted stock in the Company will vest on the Executive’s last day of employment and the Executive will receive a prorated grant of fully vested stock based on the Company’s grant to him for the prior year and the number of days employed in the year of termination and an additional grant of restricted stock (on a fully vested basis) equal to the higher of the number of shares of restricted stock that the Company had determined to grant to the Executive for the prior year, but had not yet granted as of termination, or the average number of shares of restricted stock granted to the Executive for the second, third and fourth years prior to the year in which the Executive’s employment terminates.Each of the Agreements also continues to provide that if the Company terminates the applicable Executive’s employment without cause, or the Executive terminates his employment for good reason, the Company will pay the applicable premiums for the Executive’s continued coverage under the Company’s health insurance plans pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  Act of 1985 (“COBRA”) for up to 12 months after his last day of employment with the Company or a taxable payment calculated such that the after-tax amount of the payment would be equal to the applicable COBRA health insurance premiums if the Company determines that it cannot pay COBRA premiums without a substantial risk of violating applicable law.The foregoing description of the Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Agreements, copies of which will be filed as exhibits to the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.SIGNATURES"

In its press release, the Company discloses items not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), or non-GAAP financial measures (as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), that exclude certain significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the Company’s ongoing operations. The Company believes that its non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because these are the financial measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, make day to day operating decisions, prepare internal forecasts, communicate external forward looking guidance to investors, compensate management and allocate the Company’s resources. We believe this presentation also increases comparability of period to period results. The Company’s determination of significant charges or credits may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and may vary from period to period. The Company uses both GAAP financial measures and the disclosed non-GAAP adjusted financial measures internally. These non-GAAP adjusted financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.     Non-GAAP performance net income per share is used by management as one of the primary metrics in evaluating the Company’s performance. We define non-GAAP performance net income as GAAP net income / (loss) from continuing operations attributable to shareholders adjusted for the following net of tax: (i) amortization expenses, (ii) business restructuring charges associated with Allergan’s global supply chain and operational excellence initiatives or other restructurings of a similar nature, (iii) acquisition, divestiture, integration and licensing charges, (iv) accretion and fair market value adjustments on contingent liabilities, (v) impairment/asset sales and related costs, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vi) legal settlements and (vii) other unusual charges or expenses. Non-GAAP performance net income per share is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for reported GAAP continuing operations loss per share.     We define adjusted EBITDA as an amount equal to consolidated net income / (loss) from continuing operations attributable to shareholders for such period adjusted for the following: (i) interest expense, (ii) interest income, (iii) (benefit) for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization expenses, (v) stock-based compensation expense, (vi) asset impairment charges and losses / (gains) and expenses associated with the sale of assets, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vii) business restructuring charges associated with Allergan’s global supply chain and operational excellence initiatives or other restructurings of a similar nature, (viii) costs and charges associated with the acquisition or divestiture of businesses and assets including, but not limited to, milestone payments, integration charges, other charges associated with the revaluation of assets or liabilities and charges associated with the revaluation of acquisition related contingent liabilities that are based in whole or in part on future estimated cash flows, (ix) litigation charges and settlements and (x) other unusual charges or expenses.

856,AGN,stay,2018-01-08 16:47:55,"January 8, 2018, Allergan plc (the “Company” or “Allergan”) issued a press release that discussed the anticipated impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) on the Company, and provided an update on the Company’s repurchase of its stock and the divesture of the Company’s holdings in securities of Teva Pharmaceuticals International Ltd. A copy of the press release is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.  As described in Item 7.01 below, the Company further described the anticipated impact of the TCJA. The information relating to the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 in the press release and in Item 7.01 below is incorporated herein by reference.     Tax Cut and Jobs Act  On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law by President Donald Trump. Allergan is providing the following guidance on the expected impact of the TCJA on the Company.  Overall, Allergan anticipates the future impact of the TCJA will be broadly neutral to the Company’s non-GAAP effective tax rate over time, with a moderate increase for 2018 as compared to full year 2017. The Company will provide further information on its expected effective tax rate as determined under GAAP and its non-GAAP effective tax rate as part of our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings report.  Under the TCJA, income earned by the Company’s United States (“U.S.”) subsidiaries will generally be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at a rate of 21%. A portion of this income will be eligible for a reduced rate of approximately 13%.  Income earned by the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries that are treated as “controlled foreign corporations” under the new law will generally be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at a rate of 10.5%, reduced in part by foreign tax credits. This represents the majority of the Company’s non-U.S. income. The Company’s estimates reflect this as an increase in its GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates for 2018 and going forward. However, we are continuing to assess the appropriate accounting treatment of this item, including whether or not deferred tax liabilities should be recorded for certain book in excess of tax basis differences in the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company expects the Financial Accounting Standards Board to issue guidance addressing this matter before the filing of its Form 10-K.  The Company currently anticipates recording in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 a net deferred tax benefit of $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion related to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities previously provided on the untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. This amount is provisional and will be finalized after we complete the relevant calculations. This amount will not impact the Company’s non-GAAP tax expense for 2017. These amounts do not consider any deferred tax liabilities we may determine are appropriate to record with respect to the book in excess of tax basis differences of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries, which may be material.  The TCJA also requires the Company to pay a one-time tax or “toll charge” on previously unremitted earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. The company anticipates recording in the fourth quarter of 2017 tax expense of $700-$800 million related to the “toll charge” net of estimated foreign tax credits. This amount will not impact the Company’s non-GAAP tax expense for 2017. This amount is the Company’s provisional estimate of the toll-charge and will be subject to adjustment as we finalize the relevant computations. In addition, future IRS guidance may impact the final calculation. The toll charge is payable in installments over 8 years beginning in 2018.  In addition, the TCJA contains additional provisions which may impact the company prospectively, including the “Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax” which requires the Company to determine its U.S. tax liability without regard to deductions of certain payments to affiliates. We do not anticipate that these provisions will impact the Company’s effective tax rate for 2018, but may impact the Company in future years.

Forward-Looking Statements  Statements contained in this report that refer to future events or other non-historical facts are forward-looking statements that reflect Allergan’s current perspective on existing trends and information as of the date of this report. Actual results may differ materially from Allergan’s current expectations depending upon a number of factors affecting Allergan’s business. These factors include, among others, the difficulty of predicting the timing or outcome of FDA approvals or actions, if any; the impact of competitive products and pricing; market acceptance of and continued demand for Allergan’s products; the impact of uncertainty around timing of generic entry related to key products on Allergan’s financial results; uncertainty associated with financial projections, projected cost reductions, projected synergies, restructurings, increased costs, and adverse tax consequences; difficulties or delays in manufacturing; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in Allergan’s periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to Allergan’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and Allergan’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2017.

We define non-GAAP performance net income as GAAP net income / (loss) from continuing operations attributable to shareholders adjusted for the following net of tax: (i) amortization expenses, (ii) global supply chain and operational excellence initiatives, (iii) acquisition, integration and licensing charges, (iv) accretion and fair market value adjustments on contingent liabilities, (v) impairment/asset sales and related costs, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vi) legal settlements and (vii) other unusual charges or expenses. Non-GAAP performance net income per share is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for reported GAAP continuing operations loss per share.     We define adjusted EBITDA as an amount equal to consolidated net income / (loss) from continuing operations attributable to shareholders for such period adjusted for the following: (i) interest expense, (ii) interest income, (iii) (benefit) for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization expenses, (v) stock-based compensation expense, (vi) asset impairment charges and losses / (gains) and expenses associated with the sale of assets, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vii) business restructuring charges associated with Allergan’s global supply chain and operational excellence initiatives or other restructurings of a similar nature, (viii) costs and charges associated with the acquisition of businesses and assets including, but not limited to, milestone payments, integration charges, other charges associated with the revaluation of assets or liabilities and charges associated with the revaluation of acquisition related contingent liabilities that are based in whole or in part on future estimated cash flows, (ix) litigation charges and settlements and (x) other unusual charges or expenses. We define non-GAAP adjusted operating income as adjusted EBITDA including depreciation and certain stock-based compensation expenses, but excluding dividend income.

Boccuzi as a director (“Director”) of the Company, effective immediately. The Board is currently comprised of 13 Directors. On July 19, 2017, Mr. Boccuzi was also appointed to serve on the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board.  Mr. Boccuzi retired from Spencer Stuart, Inc. (“Spencer Stuart”) in December 2016 after 24 years of service, where he played a central role in establishing and building the firm’s Life Sciences Practice. He served in positions of increasing responsibility within Spencer Stuart, most recently as a Partner in Spencer Stuart’s Global Life Sciences, Board and Chief Executive Officer Practices. Prior to joining Spencer Stuart, Mr. Boccuzi worked in executive search, venture capital and corporate management roles. He served as a consultant with Paul R. Ray & Company, an executive search firm. Prior to that, he worked as a Financial Advisor for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated. Mr. Boccuzi also held several leadership positions at National Patent Development Corporation, a venture capital firm specializing in medical technology and investment throughout the U.S. and worldwide. While there, he managed four medical startup operations, serving as chief operating officer, board member and adviser to the board of directors of each such operation. Prior to that, Mr. Boccuzi worked in sales for Xerox Corporation.  Mr. Boccuzi will receive compensation for his service as a non-employee director of the Company’s Board in accordance with the terms of the Company’s director compensation program, which is described in the Company’s Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on March 24, 2017.  In addition, on July 19, 2017, Ms. Adriane M. Brown, a current Director, was appointed to serve on the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board.  (e)  Severance Plan for Senior Management  On July 20, 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved the Allergan plc 2017 Executive Severance Plan (the “Severance Plan”). The Company’s executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, as well as certain other key management members, in each case who are designated by the Compensation Committee from time to time (collectively, the “Participants”), will participate in the Severance Plan.  The Severance Plan provides each Participant with the following severance payments and benefits upon a termination of employment either (1) by the Company without “Cause” or by the Participant for “Good Reason”, in each case, during the period beginning sixty days prior to a “Change in Control” and ending on the second anniversary of a “Change in Control” (each such capitalized term as defined in the Severance Plan) (the “CIC Protected Period”, and such termination a “CIC Termination”) or (2) by the Company without “Cause” outside of the CIC Protected Period (a “Non-CIC Termination”):           Treatment of any outstanding bonus awards, equity awards and long-term incentive awards upon any termination of employment will be governed by the terms of the applicable plan and award agreement and not by the Severance Plan.       A Participant’s receipt of severance payments and benefits under the Severance Plan is conditioned upon his or her execution of an effective release of claims against the Company and compliance with any restrictive covenants, including non-competition, non-solicitation and other customary restrictive covenants, as set forth in such release. Payments and benefits under the Severance Plan will be offset against any duplicate payments or benefits a Participant may be entitled to under any other severance plan, agreement, arrangement or program of the Company.  Participants are not entitled to receive an excise tax gross-up. Rather, any payment or benefit received by the Participant (whether payable under the terms of the Severance Plan or any other plan or arrangement with the Company or an affiliate of the Company) that would constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 280G will be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion will be subject to any excise tax but only if, by reason of such reduction, the net after-tax benefit received by the Participant exceeds the net after-tax benefit that would be received by the Participant if no reduction was made.  This summary of the Severance Plan does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Severance Plan, which will be filed with the Company’s next Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

883,AGN,down,2016-08-08 07:30:34,"August 2, 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) of Allergan plc (the “Company”) approved the amendment of the Transformation Incentive Awards (the “TIP Award”) granted to certain executives under the Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Award Plan of Allergan plc (the “Allergan Plan”) to eliminate the non-GAAP earnings per share goal (the “EPS Goal”). As a result of the amendment, amounts under the TIP Award will be earned solely based on achievement of the pre-established total shareholder return (relative to the pre-established peer group) goal approved by the Committee in connection with the grant of the TIP Award (the “Relative TSR Goal”) during the period from the March 17, 2015 through December 31, 2018 (the “TSR Performance Period”), and will remain payable, if earned, in two equal installments on December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, subject to the holder’s continued employment.  The TIP Award was granted to members of the Company’s senior management team, including the named executive officers, in connection with the Company’s merger with Allergan, Inc. (the “Allergan Acquisition”), which closed on March 17, 2015, to incentivize our executives to deliver superior performance during the critical years immediately following the Allergan Acquisition. At the time the TIP Award was granted, payment of the TIP Award was based on achievement of two performance measures that were directly related to management’s execution of the Company’s business plan during the post-closing transition period. These performance measures were the EPS Goal and Relative TSR Goal. Subsequently, the Company entered into an agreement to divest its generics business (“Allergan Generics”) to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (“Teva”). Upon closing on August 2, 2016, the Company received $33.4 billion in cash and 100.3 million shares of Teva stock valued at $5.4 billion based on the opening price of Teva shares on the date of closing, and completed the Company’s most crucial step in its evolution into a focused Branded Growth Pharma leader. However, the divestiture of the generics business will result in meaningful reduction to the Company’s going forward revenue and earnings. Given this meaningful change, the Compensation Committee determined that the EPS Goal was no longer a suitable metric to measure the performance of our management team, and would not serve to incentivize our executives’ continued integration efforts following the Allergan Acquisition.  After discussion and careful deliberation, the Compensation Committee determined to eliminate the EPS Goal, making the Relative TSR Goal the sole performance measure in the TIP Award. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, that the Relative TSR Goal would currently result in no payout of the TIP Award and will only reward our management team for sustained over-performance and execution of critical operational objectives during the 45-month TSR Performance Period, providing immediate shareholder alignment. The Relative TSR Goal and vesting schedule remains unchanged as set forth below:     1 Vesting between levels occurs via linear interpolation  2 As of date of approved amendment to the Transformation Incentive Awards (August 2, 2016)   Additionally, the Compensation Committee considered that the Relative TSR Goal reflects long-term performance, due to the length of the TSR Performance Period (45 months), is a durable goal as we continue to grow in size and complexity, will be easy to communicate to our management team and promotes executive retention due to the payment schedule.  The foregoing summary of the amendment to the Transformation Incentive Award does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Transformation Incentive Award Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.    In the second quarter of 2016, the “Company announced a realignment of its businesses to streamline operations. Prior to the realignment, the Company operated and managed its business as four distinct operating segments: US Brands, US Medical Aesthetics, International and Anda Distribution. Under the new organizational structure being reported, and the decision to hold for sale our Anda Distribution business, the Company organized its businesses into the following segments: US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International. In addition, certain revenues and shared costs, and the results of corporate initiatives, are managed outside of the three segments. Prior period results have been recast to align to the current segment presentation.       The operating segments are organized as follows:           The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for our segments represents net revenues less cost of sales (defined below), selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. Included in segment revenues are products sales that are sold through the Anda Distribution business once the Anda Distribution business has sold the product to a third party customer. These sales are included in segment results and are reclassified into revenues from discontinued operations through a reduction of Corporate revenues which eliminates the sales made by our Anda Distribution business from results of continuing operations. Cost of sales for these products in discontinued operations is equal to our average third party cost of sales for third party brand products distributed by Anda Distribution. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level:              The Company defines segment net revenues as product sales and other revenue derived from branded products or licensing agreements.  Cost of sales within segment contribution includes standard production and packaging costs for the products the Company manufactures, third party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements and finished goods inventory reserve charges. Cost of sales included within segment contribution does not include non-standard production costs, such as non-finished goods inventory obsolescence charges, manufacturing variances and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles.  Selling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.  General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation and settlement costs and professional services costs which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.       Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K provides recast segment contribution as defined above for the three months ended June 30, 2016, March 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and March 31, 2015.  The recasting of previously issued financial information does not represent a restatement of previously issued financial statements and does not affect the Company’s reported net (loss) / income, earnings per share, total assets, or stockholders’ equity for any of the previously reported periods. The information contained in this Form 8-K is being furnished pursuant to Regulation FD in order to provide the financial community with historical financial data that is presented on a basis consistent with the Company’s new reporting structure.

In its press release, the Company discloses items not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), or non-GAAP financial measures (as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), that exclude certain significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the Company’s ongoing operations. The Company believes that its inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates analysis by investors in evaluating the Company’s performance and trends. The determination of significant charges or credits may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and may vary from period to period. The Company uses both GAAP financial measures and the disclosed non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate and manage the Company’s operations and to better understand its business. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.     Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We define non-GAAP net income as consolidated net income / (loss) for such period adjusted for the following net of tax: (i) amortization expenses, (ii) global supply chain initiative, (iii) acquisition, integration and licensing, (iv) accretion on contingent liabilities, (v) impairment/asset sales and related costs, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vi) legal settlements and (vii) other unusual charges or expenses. We define adjusted EBITDA as an amount equal to consolidated net income / (loss) from continuing operations attributable to shareholders for such period adjusted for the following: (i) interest expense, (ii) interest income, (iii) (benefit) for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization expenses, (v) stock-based compensation expense, (vi) asset impairment charges and losses / (gains) and expenses associated with the sale of assets, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vii) business restructuring charges associated with Allergan’s Global Supply Chain and Operational Excellence Initiatives or other restructurings of a similar nature, (viii) costs and charges associated with the acquisition of businesses and assets including, but not limited to, milestone payments, integration charges, other charges associated with the revaluation of assets or liabilities and charges associated with the revaluation of acquisition related contingent liabilities that are based in whole or in part on future estimated cash flows, (ix) litigation charges and settlements and (x) other unusual charges or expenses. We define non-GAAP operating income as adjusted EBITDA including depreciation and certain stock-based compensation charges.

901,ADS,stay,2017-11-24 13:01:23,"November 22, 2017, the Board of Directors (""Board"") of Alliance Data Systems Corporation (the ""Company"") approved the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, amended and restated effective January 1, 2018 (the ""Plan"") to permit selected qualified associates to defer a portion of their base salary or incentive compensation as defined in the Plan.     To be eligible to participate in the Plan, an associate must: (1) be a regular, full-time U.S. employee of ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc.; (2) receive a base salary equal to or greater than $150,000 on an annual basis; and (3) be designated by the committee of management that administers the Plan.  The Plan allows the participant to contribute up to 50% of eligible compensation as defined in the Plan on a pre‐tax basis. At the time of enrollment, a participant may elect to defer payment of a percentage of the participant's base salary and non-equity incentive compensation to be earned for services performed in the following year.  The percentage selected for each type of compensation is determined by the participant and may be any whole number percentage up to 50%.  A participant may not revoke, change or terminate an election to defer compensation under the Plan at any time following the end of the applicable enrollment period.     Participant deferrals under the Plan are unfunded and subject to the claims of our creditors, with participants having the status of an unsecured creditor with respect to our obligation to make benefit payments. Each participant is 100% vested in his or her account. In the event of a change in control, as defined under the Plan, we may establish a rabbi trust to which we will contribute sufficient assets to fully fund all accounts under the Plan. The assets in the rabbi trust will remain subject to the claims of our creditors. Account balances accrue interest at a rate that is established and adjusted periodically by the committee of management that administers the Plan.     A participant who is actively employed generally may not withdraw, borrow or otherwise access any amounts credited under the Plan.  However, at the time a participant elects to make elective contributions, that participant may elect to have all contributions made pursuant to that election for that year distributed as of January 1 of any subsequent year, subject however, to any restriction imposed under IRC Section 409A. The distribution will be made within 60 days of January 1 of the specified year or, if earlier, the date required in the event of cessation of employment, retirement or disability, as described below.  Furthermore, amounts may be withdrawn in the event of an ""unforeseeable emergency,"" within the meaning of IRC Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii).  Any such early withdrawal must be approved by the committee of management administering the Plan and may not exceed the amount necessary to meet the emergency, taking into account other assets available to the participant, as well as any taxes incurred as a result of the distribution.  If the committee of management administering the Plan approves a distribution on this basis, the distribution will be made as soon as practicable thereafter; and the participant's right to make elective contributions will be suspended until the first day of the following year, subject to enrollment procedures.  If a participant separates from service or becomes disabled, the participant will receive the value of his or her account within 90 days after he or she became eligible for the distribution unless the participant is a ""specified participant"" under IRC Section 409A, in which case a distribution due to separation from service will be paid on the date that is six months and one day after the date of separation, unless the ""specified participant"" dies before that time. In the event of a participant's death, the balance of the account will be distributed in one lump sum to the participant's designated beneficiary or estate within 90 days after the date of the participant's death.  A distribution from the Plan is taxed as ordinary income and is not eligible for any special tax treatment.  The Plan is designed and administered to comply with the IRC Section 409A regulations.     The preceding summary of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in the attached press release.Founders' LetterA is for AlphabetHard to believe we are about a quarter short of two years of announcing Alphabet. It’s been busy! I certainly feel Alphabet is working well, and as intended (see the original “G is for Google” announcement). At the time, I wrote that “Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence.” The new structure has helped entrepreneurs build and run companies with the autonomy and speed they need.Sergey and I are working well together on the overall Alphabet direction and providing guidance to the companies. Sundar is doing great as Google CEO. It’s certainly a big job and we are very lucky to have him. He’ll probably write this letter again in the future as he has in the past, so I won’t speak too much for him on the Google related topics in this one. But, I’m excited about how he is leading the company with a focus on machine learning and AI. We took a big step in that direction with the Google Assistant, and built it into a new family of hardware devices like the Pixel and Google Home. There’s a lot more to come.We’ve had a number of significant things happen on the Alphabet side since I last wrote. A number of our projects became companies, with more autonomy and dedicated leadership.Waymo is the new self-driving car company formed from Project Chauffeur at X. John Krafcik is the new CEO and brings significant auto industry experience. I love the name and I love even more the excitement you can see when you visit with them! They also formed a partnership with Fiat Chrysler around their new plug-in hybrid Pacifica minivan which I see driving around the Waymo offices with lots of sensors on it. I can’t wait until Waymo launches.Verily Life Sciences launched in December 2015 with Andy Conrad as founding CEO, also coming out of X. They have launched myriad efforts and raised $800M from Temasek, who joined their board and will help with Asian expansion. I’m very fond of their Debug project, which aims to stop mosquitoes in their tracks. It has been running for a while, showing some good foresight because it was started before Zika became a big concern.In June 2016, Marwan Fawaz became CEO of Nest. He has been doing great against their plan, and we have really been enjoying working with him! I recommend you buy all their excellent products including indoor and outdoor cameras, learning thermostats, and smoke alarms.Very recently Greg McCray started as CEO of Google Fiber. I’ve been enjoying working with him and his team and he has rapidly been getting up to speed. He visited all of our Fiber cities so quickly that I think he was still a bit out of breath when he got back to Mountain View! We have made significant investments in bringing gigabit fiber internet to lots of happy customers and I’m excited about our opportunities to do it better.We have many other efforts within Alphabet. Calico CEO Art Levinson, former CEO of Genentech, is building an amazing research and development company focused on aging. We also have newly branded investment arms, GV (formerly Google Ventures), and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital) which are doing well. Sergey is continuing to spend time working with the X moonshot factory. They have a number of efforts like Wing, which is doing drone delivery. I also can’t wait for them to launch!With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility. We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down. I also think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success. Our recent launch of Waymo was a great example of our learnings. In general we are taking a patient approach to investing our capital, especially significant uses. We’re not going to invest if we don’t see great opportunities and we feel like our track record for picking some important efforts long before others is pretty good. Machine learning and all the efforts around Google Brain and DeepMind are good examples. Google Cloud led by Diane Greene is doing a fabulous job of getting our machine learning hardware and software out to everyone. We were early in machine learning and are already seeing significant dividends coming out. Many of the Alphabet companies are already using this technology and are planning to use it even more.So in conclusion, Sergey and I are having a good time looking for new opportunities and managing and scaling our existing efforts. I still see amazing opportunities that just aren’t quite fully developed yet—and helping making them real is what I get excited about.        - Larry Page, CEO, AlphabetImportant InformationSHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT MATERIALS THAT ALPHABET WILL FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE “SEC”) CAREFULLY IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.

A newly formed Belgian company, which retained the name Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“AB InBev”), has become the holding company for the combined SABMiller and Legacy AB InBev businesses.  Under the terms of the Transaction, SABMiller shareholders receive 45 British pounds (“GBP”) in cash for each SABMiller share held, with a partial share alternative (“PSA”) available for approximately 41% of the SABMiller shares. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Irrevocable Undertaking previously delivered by Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”), a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 99.2 to Altria’s Current Report on Form 8-K (“Form 8-K”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 12, 2015, Altria voted its 430,000,000 SABMiller shares in favor of the Transaction and elected the PSA.  In connection with the completion of the Transaction, Altria receives, in respect of its 430,000,000 SABMiller shares, (i) an interest that converts into 185,115,417 restricted shares of AB InBev (the “Restricted Shares”), representing a 9.6% economic and voting interest in AB InBev based on AB InBev’s shares outstanding, and (ii) approximately $5.3 billion in pre-tax cash, comprised of approximately $4.8 billion as the cash component of the PSA (taking into account proration) and approximately $0.5 billion from the settlement of the derivative financial instruments discussed below.  The Restricted Shares:Based on Altria’s 9.6% ownership level in AB InBev, Martin J. Barrington, Altria’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and William F. Gifford, Jr., Altria’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, have been appointed to AB InBev’s Board of Directors.Also in connection with the completion of the Transaction, on October 8, 2016, Altria entered into a voting and support agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) with two other AB InBev shareholders, BEVCO Ltd. and Stichting Anheuser-Busch InBev, pursuant to which, among other things, the parties are required to exercise their voting rights in AB InBev in order to give effect to the director appointment rights set forth in AB InBev’s Articles of Association (including the nomination rights of the holders of Restricted Shares and the nomination rights of Stichting Anheuser-Busch InBev).Altria will account for its investment in AB InBev under the equity method of accounting.  As previously disclosed, Altria will report its share of AB InBev’s results using a one-quarter lag because AB InBev’s results will not be available in time to record them in the concurrent period.  For example, Altria’s share of AB InBev’s results for the relevant, post-closing portion of the fourth quarter of 2016 will be recorded 2in Altria’s 2017 first-quarter consolidated statement of earnings.  Previously, Altria recorded results for its SABMiller investment concurrently with Altria’s reporting calendar.  Altria and Legacy AB InBev entered into an information rights agreement pursuant to which, following completion of the Transaction, AB InBev will provide Altria with certain financial information necessary to assist Altria in connection with its financial reporting, financial controls and financial planning (the “Information Rights Agreement”).As a result of the Transaction, Altria expects to record a total estimated pre-tax gain in its reported earnings of approximately $13.7 billion, or $8.9 billion after-tax, which is based on the following:Substantially all of the gain will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Altria expects that its gain on the Transaction will be deferred for United States corporate income tax purposes, except to the extent of the cash consideration received.  Altria and Legacy AB InBev entered into an amended and restated tax matters agreement providing for certain covenants, representations and warranties and indemnification obligations of Legacy AB InBev and AB InBev in connection with the tax treatment of the Transaction and the provision of information necessary to assist Altria in connection with its United States federal income tax reporting (the “Tax Matters Agreement”).In November 2015 and August 2016, Altria entered into a derivative financial instrument, each in the form of a put option (together the “options”) to hedge Altria’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements in the GBP to the USD, in relation to the pre-tax cash consideration that Altria expected to receive under the PSA pursuant to the revised and final offer announced by Legacy AB InBev on July 26, 2016.  The options do not qualify for hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair values of the options are recorded in Altria’s consolidated statements of earnings in the periods in which the changes occur.  From inception of the options, Altria’s estimated cumulative pre-tax gain is approximately $0.3 billion and its estimated pre-tax cash proceeds are approximately $0.5 billion. The foregoing descriptions of the Voting Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Information Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Information Rights Agreement, copies of which are attached as Exhibit 99.2, Exhibit 99.3 and Exhibit 99.4, respectively, and incorporated by reference in this Form 8-K.3Item 7.01.    Regulation FD Disclosure.On October 11, 2016, Altria issued a press release announcing the completion of the Transaction and, among other things, that it has expanded its share repurchase program and revised its 2016 full-year earnings per share (“EPS”) guidance.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference in this Form 8-K.In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.  The information in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document. Item 8.01.    Other Events.On October 11, 2016, Altria issued a press release announcing the completion of the Transaction and, among other things, that it has expanded its share repurchase program and revised its 2016 full-year EPS guidance.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference in this Form 8-K, except for the section “2016 Full-Year Guidance and Long-Term Financial Goals.”Expanded Share Repurchase ProgramAltria’s Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion expansion of Altria’s current July 2015 share repurchase program from $1 billion to $3 billion.  Altria expects to complete the program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.  The timing of share repurchases under this program depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of Altria’s Board of Directors.Gain on TransactionAs a result of the Transaction, Altria expects to record a total estimated pre-tax gain in its reported earnings of approximately $13.7 billion, or $4.55 per share, substantially all of which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 (the “Gain”). 2016 Full-Year Guidance To reflect the previously disclosed one-quarter lag in reporting Altria’s share of AB InBev’s results, Altria has revised its 2016 full-year forecast for adjusted diluted EPS growth rate to a range of 6.5% to 8.5% over 2015 full-year adjusted diluted EPS.  This forecasted growth rate excludes the Gain, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.28 per share resulting from the completion of Altria’s September 2016 debt tender offer, the gain on derivative financial instruments incurred from July 1, 2016 through October 14, 2016, and the net expenses in the table below. Altria’s full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, the Gain, SABMiller special items, certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, and settlements of, and determinations made in connection with, certain non-participating manufacturer (“NPM”) 4adjustment disputes under the Master Settlement Agreement (such settlements and determinations are referred to collectively as “NPM Adjustment Items”).Altria’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on Altria’s reported diluted EPS because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable.  As a result, Altria does not provide a corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted EPS guidance. The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K represent continuing risks to this forecast.Altria reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP.  Altria’s management reviews certain financial results, including diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items, including those items noted above.  Altria’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of Altria’s sustainable results as they may be highly variable, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results.  Altria’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results.  Altria’s management uses adjusted financial measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.  These adjusted financial measures are not consistent with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.  These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  5Item 9.01.

Pricing of Tender Offer  On September 19, 2016, Altria issued a press release announcing the reference yield and total consideration for its previously announced cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) for any and all of its senior unsecured 9.95% Notes due 2038 (the “2038 Notes”) and any and all of its senior unsecured 10.20% Notes due 2039 (the “2039 Notes” and, together with the 2038 Notes, the “Notes”). A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K.  Expiration of Tender Offer  On September 20, 2016, Altria issued a press release announcing that the Tender Offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Monday, September 19, 2016. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K, except for the section “2016 Third Quarter Charge and 2016 Full-Year Earnings and Tax Rate Guidance.”  This Current Report on Form 8-K is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of offers to buy any securities. The Tender Offer was made only pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery.  2016 Third Quarter Charge and 2016 Full-Year Earnings and Tax Rate Guidance  Altria will record a one-time, pre-tax charge against reported earnings in the third quarter of 2016 of approximately $825 million, or $0.28 per share, reflecting the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the Tender Offer (the “Charge”).  Altria reaffirms its previously announced guidance that its 2016 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) growth rate is expected to be in the range of 7.5% to 9.5% over 2015 full-year adjusted diluted EPS. This forecasted growth rate excludes the Charge and the net expenses in the table below. Altria expects that its 2016 full-year effective tax rate on operations will increase from approximately 35.3% to 35.4% due to a reduction in certain consolidated tax benefits resulting from the Tender Offer. These forecasts do not include any impact from the     2         proposed Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“AB InBev”) and SABMiller plc (“SABMiller”) business combination, including effects of Altria’s expected one-quarter lag in reporting its share of the combined businesses’ results, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals. Altria’s full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance and full-year forecast for its effective tax rate on operations exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, SABMiller special items, certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, and settlements of, and determinations made in connection with, certain non-participating manufacturer (“NPM”) adjustment disputes (such settlements and determinations are referred to collectively as “NPM Adjustment Items”).  Altria’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on its reported diluted EPS and its reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result, Altria does not provide a corresponding GAAP (as defined below) measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted EPS guidance or its effective tax rate on operations forecast.  The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of the press release attached as Exhibit 99.2 represent continuing risks to this forecast.  Expense (Income), Net Excluded from Adjusted Diluted EPS     Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Altria’s management reviews certain financial results, including diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items, including those items noted above. Altria’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of Altria’s sustainable results as they may be highly variable, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results.

Item 8.01.    Other Events.On November 11, 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“AB InBev”) announced its firm offer to effect a business combination with SABMiller plc (“SABMiller”) in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $107 billion.  Under the terms of the transaction, SABMiller shareholders will receive 44 British pounds in cash for each SABMiller share, with a partial share alternative (“PSA”) available for approximately 41% of the SABMiller shares.  Under the terms of the PSA, SABMiller shareholders may elect to receive for each SABMiller share held (i) 0.483969 restricted shares (the “Restricted Shares”) in a newly formed Belgian company (“NewCo”) that will own the combined SABMiller and AB InBev business plus (ii) 3.7788 British pounds in cash.  On November 10, 2015, the Board of Directors of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”) authorized Altria to provide an irrevocable undertaking to vote Altria’s shares of SABMiller in favor of the proposed transaction and to elect the PSA (the “Irrevocable Undertaking”).  Altria delivered the Irrevocable Undertaking on November 11, 2015.  If the transaction is completed, NewCo will acquire SABMiller and, following the closing of that acquisition, AB InBev will merge into NewCo.  Altria expects to exchange its approximate 27% economic and voting interest in SABMiller for an interest that will be converted into Restricted Shares representing an approximate 10.5% economic and voting interest in NewCo plus approximately $2.5 billion in cash (subject to proration as further described below).  The Restricted Shares of NewCo will: With the exception of the cash consideration Altria expects to receive in the transaction, Altria expects that the transaction will result in a deferral of United States corporate income tax for Altria.  Altria and 2AB InBev have entered into a tax matters agreement providing for certain covenants, representations and warranties and indemnification obligations of AB InBev and NewCo in connection with the tax treatment of the transaction and the provision of information necessary to assist Altria in connection with its United States federal income tax reporting (the “Tax Matters Agreement”).Based on the anticipated structure of the transaction, Altria expects to account for its investment in NewCo under the equity method of accounting.  Altria and AB InBev have entered into an information rights agreement pursuant to which, following completion of the transaction, NewCo will provide Altria with certain financial information necessary to assist Altria in connection with its financial reporting, financial controls and financial planning (the “Information Rights Agreement”).  Upon closing of the transaction, Altria estimates that it will record a one-time pre-tax accounting gain of approximately $12 billion, or $8 billion after-tax.  This estimate is based on the AB InBev share price and British pound to United States dollar exchange rate as of November 10, 2015, and the book value of Altria’s investment in SABMiller at September 30, 2015.  The actual gain recorded at closing may vary significantly from this estimate based on changes to these factors and any proration of Restricted Shares as discussed further below.If the transaction is completed, Altria expects to receive Restricted Shares under the PSA representing approximately 10.5% economic and voting interest in NewCo; however, the number of shares that Altria receives and its corresponding percentage ownership of NewCo at closing are subject to proration because the PSA limits the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the offer to 326 million NewCo Restricted Shares.  To the extent that elections for the PSA exceed this maximum number and cannot be satisfied in full, the equity portion of all PSA elections will be adjusted downwards on a pro rata basis.  It is possible that significant proration could (i) reduce Altria’s projected percentage ownership of NewCo; (ii) increase the amount of cash that Altria receives; (iii) increase the amount of the pre-tax gain recorded by Altria; (iv) impose additional tax liabilities on Altria; and (v) impact Altria’s ability to account for its investment in NewCo under the equity method of accounting.The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including without limitation shareholder approvals of both SABMiller and AB InBev, and receiving the required regulatory approvals. On November 11, 2015 Altria entered into a derivative financial instrument to hedge Altria’s exposure to the British pound in conjunction with the cash consideration that Altria expects to receive under the PSA.  This derivative financial instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting; therefore changes in the fair value of this instrument will be recorded as a reported pre-tax gain or loss on Altria’s consolidated statement of earnings in the periods the changes occur.  The foregoing descriptions of the Irrevocable Undertaking, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Information Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Irrevocable Undertaking, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Information Rights Agreement, copies of which are attached as Exhibit 99.2, Exhibit 99.3 and Exhibit 99.4, respectively, and incorporated by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K.Forward-Looking and Cautionary StatementsThis Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements included in this Current Report on Form 8-K are 3described in Altria’s publicly filed reports, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015.  In addition, the factors related to AB InBev’s proposed transaction to effect a business combination with SABMiller include the following: the risk that one or more conditions to closing the proposed transaction may not be satisfied; the risk that a shareholder or regulatory approval required for the proposed transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; AB InBev’s inability to achieve the contemplated synergies and value creation from the proposed transaction; the fact that Altria’s election to receive transaction consideration in the form of equity is subject to proration, which may result in a reduced percentage ownership of the combined company, additional tax liabilities and/or changes in Altria’s accounting treatment of the investment; the fact that the equity securities to be received by Altria as transaction consideration will be subject to restrictions on transfer lasting five years from completion of the proposed transaction; the risk that AB InBev’s share price, which affects the value of Altria’s transaction consideration, will fluctuate based on a variety of factors which are beyond Altria’s control; the fact that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound would adversely affect Altria’s cash consideration as the British pound would translate into fewer U.S. dollars; and the risk that the tax treatment of Altria’s transaction consideration is not guaranteed and that the tax treatment of the dividends Altria receives from NewCo may not be as favorable as dividends from SABMiller.

This allowed the Company to gain valuable feedback from its shareholders regarding proxy access.Section 2.16 of the Bylaws has been added and permits a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials directors constituting up to 20% of the Board of Directors, provided that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws. The Bylaw amendments also include changes to the deadline for notice of matters to be considered at shareholder meetings, and make other ministerial, clarifying, and conforming changes. The amendments to the Bylaws are effective immediately, except that the amendment in Section 2.5.1 setting forth the period for advance notice of business or nominations to be presented at an annual meeting of shareholders is effective as of April 12, 2016, so that the notice period with respect to the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of shareholders remains as set forth in the Company’s 2015 proxy statement.This description of the amendments to the Bylaws is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this Form 8-K.

1088,AEE,stay,2016-07-01 15:29:56,"July 1, 2016, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for electric service by $206 million, which would result in an average 7.8% increase in base rates. The rate request includes $74 million that is primarily related to nearly $1.4 billion of gross electric infrastructure investments that have been placed into service since the true-up date in Ameren Missouri’s last electric rate case. This $74 million includes $39 million of related depreciation expenses, $25 million of return on rate base, and $10 million of increased property taxes. The rate request also includes $51 million related to reduced customer sales volumes, including reductions from the idling of operations at Noranda Aluminum, Inc.’s (“Noranda”) aluminum smelter, and $34 million related to increases in transmission charges, in particular transmission charges from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. Other changes in expenses reflected in the rate request include decreases in pension and other post-employment benefit plan expenses of $24 million and solar rebate expenses of $15 million, both of which are subject to regulatory tracking mechanisms; increased net energy costs, excluding the impact of reduced Noranda and other customer sales volumes, of $23 million; and increased income taxes of $15 million. Net energy costs include fuel and purchased power costs, including transportation but excluding transmission revenues and substantially all transmission charges, net of off-system sales revenues.  The electric rate increase request is based on a 9.9% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 51.8% equity, an electric rate base for Ameren Missouri of $7.2 billion, and a test year ended March 31, 2016, with certain pro-forma adjustments expected through the anticipated true-up date of December 31, 2016.  As a part of its filing, Ameren Missouri requested the amortization over ten years of an estimated $81 million of lost fixed cost recovery due to lower sales volumes from its historically largest customer, Noranda, during the period April 2015 through May 2017. In March 2016, Noranda idled production at the smelter and also filed voluntary petitions for a court-supervised restructuring process under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As a result of these events, Ameren Missouri has not and will not fully recover its revenue requirement until rates are adjusted by the MoPSC in this electric rate case to reflect Noranda’s actual sales volumes.       Ameren Missouri also requested continued use of its fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism and the regulatory tracking mechanisms for pension and postretirement benefits and uncertain income tax positions that the MoPSC previously authorized in earlier electric rate orders, and requested the implementation of a new tracking mechanism for transmission charges and revenues.  The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed electric service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the MoPSC in such proceeding expected by late April 2017 and new rates effective in late May 2017. Ameren Missouri cannot predict the level of any electric service rate change the MoPSC may approve, when any rate change may go into effect, whether the requested regulatory tracking mechanisms will be approved, or whether any rate increase that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for Ameren Missouri to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when the increase goes into effect.

1093,AEE,stay,2016-01-19 06:05:32,"January 8, 2016, Noranda announced that production had been idled at two of its three pot lines at the smelter following an electric supply circuit failure. The circuit failure did not occur on assets owned by Ameren Missouri. The third pot line was not directly affected and that line’s production has continued. On January 13, 2016, Noranda announced that the smelter’s “remaining operations will be curtailed on or before March 12, 2016, unless [Noranda] is able to secure a substantially more sustainable power rate for the smelter and materially improve [Noranda’s] overall liquidity.” Ameren Missouri has been working, well in advance of recent events, with Noranda, legislators and other stakeholders on a potential legislative solution to support Noranda’s operations.  In its April 2015 electric rate order, the MoPSC approved a rate design that established $78 million in annual revenues, net of fuel and purchased power costs, as Noranda’s portion of Ameren Missouri’s revenue requirement. The portion of Ameren Missouri’s annual revenue requirement reflected in Noranda’s electric rate is based on the smelter using approximately 4.2 million megawatthours annually, which is approximately 100% of its operating capacity. Ameren Missouri’s rates, including those for Noranda, are seasonal. Noranda’s summer base rate (June through September) is $45.78 per megawatthour and its winter base rate (October through May) is $31.11 per megawatthour.  To the extent actual sales volumes to Noranda are below the sales volumes reflected in rates due to operating, financial, or other difficulties at Noranda, Ameren Missouri may not fully recover its revenue requirement until rates are adjusted by the MoPSC in a future electric rate case to accurately reflect Noranda’s actual sales volumes. In light of the Noranda announcements described above, Ameren Missouri expects to employ a provision in its fuel adjustment clause (“FAC”) tariff that, under certain circumstances, allows Ameren Missouri to retain a portion of the revenues from any off-system sales it makes as a result of the reduced tariff sales to Noranda. The current market price of electricity is less than Noranda’s electric rate, and Ameren Missouri expects market prices to remain below Noranda’s electric rate during 2016. Accordingly, this FAC provision would not enable Ameren Missouri to fully cover its revenue requirement under current market conditions.       Ameren Missouri may request an accounting authority order from the MoPSC pursuant to which Ameren Missouri could be allowed to seek additional revenue in a subsequent rate case for certain costs incurred but not contemporaneously recovered as a result of Noranda’s reduced operations. Although Ameren Missouri has not decided when to file its next electric rate case, on January 11, 2016, Ameren Missouri filed a notice with the MoPSC which would enable Ameren Missouri to file a rate case after 60 days. If Ameren Missouri elects to file a rate case to request adjustment of its electric rates to reflect Noranda’s actual sales volumes and mitigate the revenue shortfall, the proceedings in any such rate case would take place over a period of up to 11 months from the date of filing. Ameren Missouri will continue to monitor Noranda’s sales volumes and evaluate its regulatory and legislative options to mitigate adverse financial impacts. If these efforts are not successful, the reduction in Noranda’s sales volumes would adversely affect Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity until customer rates are adjusted in a future rate case.

The ICC proceedings relating to the proposed natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the ICC required by December 2015 and new rates expected to be effective in January 2016. AIC cannot predict the level of any natural gas delivery service rate change that the ICC may approve, when any rate change may go into effect, or whether any rate increase that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for AIC to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when such increase goes into effect.

(American Airlines or the Company) recently received an unsolicited notice from Qatar Airways indicating Qatar Airways’ intention to make a significant investment in American Airlines. As a publicly traded company, American Airlines’ common stock is available for purchase on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and Qatar Airways has indicated that its purchase would be made on the open market.  Consistent with the notice, Qatar Airways has also submitted a filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (HSR Act) with respect to its potential investment in American Airlines common stock. A filing under the HSR Act is required for an acquisition by Qatar Airways of more than approximately $81 million of American Airlines common stock, and is subject to review by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice in accordance with the HSR Act. The notice advised that Qatar Airways intends to purchase at least $808 million and, in a conversation between the CEOs of the two companies initiated by the Qatar Airways CEO, Qatar Airways indicated that it has an interest in acquiring approximately a ten percent stake. American Airlines will respond in due course with the appropriate filings required under the HSR Act.  The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation prohibits anyone from acquiring 4.75% or more of the Company’s outstanding stock without advance approval from the Board following a written request in accordance with the procedures set forth therein. The Board has not received any such request. The Company also notes that there are foreign ownership laws that limit the total percentage of foreign voting interest to 24.9%.  The proposed investment by Qatar Airways was not solicited by American Airlines and would in no way change the Company’s Board composition, governance, management or strategic direction. It also does not alter American Airlines’ conviction on the need to enforce the Open Skies agreements with the United Arab Emirates and the nation of Qatar and ensure fair competition with Gulf carriers, including Qatar Airways. American Airlines continues to believe that the President and his administration will stand up to foreign governments to end massive carrier subsidies that threaten the U.S. aviation industry and that threaten American jobs.  * * * * * * * *       SIGNATURES  "

The Amended Agreement provides for a $1.25 billion term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a revolving credit facility that may be established in the future (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).  Immediately prior to the Closing Date, $970.0 million principal amount of loans were outstanding under the 2013 Loan Agreement. On the Closing Date, American borrowed $1.25 billion under the Term Loan Facility. The incremental proceeds of the Term Loan Facility will be used for general corporate purposes. Term loans under the Amended Agreement mature on December 14, 2023.  Voluntary prepayments may be made by American at any time, with a premium of 1% applicable to certain prepayments made prior to the date that is six months following the Closing Date. Mandatory prepayments at par of term loans and/or revolving loans (if any) under the Amended Agreement are required to the extent necessary to comply with American’s covenants regarding the collateral coverage ratio and certain dispositions of the Collateral (as defined herein). In addition, if a “change of control” (as defined in the Amended Agreement) occurs with respect to AAG, American will be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the Amended Agreement and terminate any Revolving Credit Facility.  Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at an index rate plus an applicable index margin or, at American’s option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus an applicable LIBOR margin for interest periods of one, three or six months (or, if available to all affected Lenders, 12 months or a shorter period). The LIBOR margin is 2.50% for borrowings under the Term Loan Facility.  The obligations of American under the Amended Agreement are secured by a lien on certain airport take-off and landing slots at LaGuardia Airport and Ronald Regan Washington National Airport and certain flight simulators owned by AAG or its restricted subsidiaries (the “Collateral”). American has the ability to add certain types of assets to the Collateral and, subject to certain conditions, release Collateral, in each case from time to time at its discretion.  The Amended Agreement requires American to periodically appraise the value of the Collateral and calculate the collateral coverage ratio. If the calculated collateral coverage ratio is below 1.6 to 1.0, American may be required either to provide additional Collateral (which may include cash collateral) to secure its obligations under the Amended Agreement or repay the loans under the Amended Agreement or certain other indebtedness, in such amounts that the recalculated collateral coverage ratio, after giving effect to any such additional collateral or repayment, is at least 1.6 to 1.0.  The Amended Agreement also includes affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur liens on the Collateral, dispose of the Collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions. In addition, under the Amended Agreement, AAG must maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity of $2.0 billion.  The Amended Agreement contains events of default customary for similar financings, including cross-default to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Amended Agreement may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately.

On July 26, 2016, the Audit Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the financial statements of AEP and its subsidiary registrants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. The Audit Committee invited several accounting firms to participate in a competitive bidding process, including Deloitte & Touche LLP. The decision to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was made by the Audit Committee.

Based on the approval of the shareholder proposal at the 2015 annual meeting and the feedback received from AEP's stockholders during the engagement process, the Board designed a proxy access framework for AEP which it believes will provide meaningful access for stockholders while safeguarding the long-term interests of AEP and its stockholders and limiting the potential for abuse.Section 19 has been added to the By-Laws to permit a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials directors constituting up to the greater of (i) 20% of the Board or (ii) two directors, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-Laws.The By-Laws were also amended to add Section 18 to add advance notice provisions for director nominations and other business at the annual meeting of stockholders.The description of the amendments to the By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the By-Laws filed as Exhibit 3(b) to this report.Item 9.01.

1196,AXP,stay,2018-01-03 14:59:56,"December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The new law makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and it will take time to interpret the changes. Based on our current understanding of the law following a preliminary review, we estimate significant impacts to our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings, as well as future periods.  In particular, the transition to the new territorial tax system will cause us to incur a deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate will cause us to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower base rate of 21 percent. We estimate the overall impacts of the Tax Act will reduce earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 by approximately $2.4 billion and thus we expect to report a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017. Due to the impacts of the Tax Act, we expect full year 2017 earnings per share to be below our $5.80 to $5.90 guidance range.  The impacts of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter will reduce our regulatory capital and our capital ratios, although our capital ratios are expected to remain well above all minimum regulatory capital requirements and the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate increases our future capacity to generate capital. We continued to repurchase shares during the fourth quarter, and will assess any potential suspension, reductions or timing modifications to our share repurchases during the first half of 2018 when we have fully interpreted the impacts from the Tax Act.  While the Tax Act will negatively impact earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017, the lower corporate rate is expected to be a significant ongoing benefit to us. Beginning in 2018, we anticipate an effective tax rate in the low twenties before discrete tax items.  We will announce financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, on January 18, 2018.

1243,AIG,stay,2017-05-15 07:33:56,"May 15, 2017, American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) announced that its Board of Directors (“Board”) appointed Brian Duperreault as President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board, and Peter D. Hancock resigned from his roles as President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board in accordance with AIG’s previously disclosed succession plan, effective May 14, 2017 (the “Transition Date”). Mr. Duperreault was previously Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. (“Hamilton”).  To enable Mr. Duperreault’s prompt appointment free of conflicts of interest and to continue to accelerate its application of cutting-edge technology to insurance underwriting, AIG simultaneously entered into various arrangements with Hamilton, Two Sigma Insurance Quantified, LP (“Two Sigma”) and Attune Holdings, LLC (“Attune”). These arrangements, which are described in more detail below, provide for the release of Mr. Duperreault from his existing restrictive covenants and the divestiture of his interests in Hamilton, AIG’s purchase of Hamilton’s U.S. operations, the exploration of a technology relationship with Two Sigma and the expansion of the existing Attune joint venture between affiliates of Hamilton, Two Sigma and AIG.  Biographical Background  Mr. Duperreault, age 70, was appointed as AIG’s President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board effective May 14, 2017. Mr. Duperreault was previously the Chief Executive Officer of Hamilton, a Bermuda-based holding company of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance operations in Bermuda, the U.S. and the UK, from December 2013 to May 2017, and served as Chairman of Hamilton from February 2016 to May 2017. He served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. from February 2008 until his retirement in December 2012. Before joining Marsh, he served as non-executive Chairman of ACE Limited from 2006 through the end of 2007 and as Chief Executive Officer from October 1994 to May 2004. Prior to joining ACE, Mr. Duperreault served in various senior executive positions with AIG and its affiliates from 1973 to 1994. Mr. Duperreault is a director of Johnson Controls International plc, where he is a member of the Corporate Governance Committee, and was a director of Tyco International plc from 2004 to 2016, when it merged with Johnson Controls International plc. In light of Mr. Duperreault’s deep experience in the insurance industry, his history with AIG and his management of large, complex, international institutions, AIG’s Board has concluded that Mr. Duperreault should be elected to the Board.  Letter Agreement with Mr. Duperreault  On May 14, 2017, AIG entered into an agreement with Mr. Duperreault (the “Letter Agreement”) establishing his compensation as President and Chief Executive Officer. Under the Letter Agreement, Mr. Duperreault’s initial compensation will consist of an annual base salary of $1.6 million, a short-term annual incentive target of $3.2 million (which will be prorated for 2017 and is not subject to any guarantee) and an annual long-term incentive award of $11.2 million. For 2017, consistent with AIG’s compensation program for other executive officers, Mr. Duperreault’s long-term incentive award is 70% in the form of performance share units earned based on achievement of performance criteria for the three-year performance period covering January 2017 through December 2019, and 30% in the form of restricted stock units earned based on continued employment through such three-year period.  In addition, Mr. Duperreault will receive a one-time, make-whole cash award of $12 million as compensation for unvested Hamilton equity awards to be forfeited by him in connection with his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of AIG, and a one-time, sign-on award of stock options (the “Stock Options”) to purchase 1,500,000 shares of AIG common stock (the “Shares”) for an exercise price equal to the fair market value per Share on the Transition Date and having a seven-year term, as follows:                 The Stock Options are exercisable only after vesting, are subject to the terms of the American International Group, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) and, other than the $20 Inducement Options and $30 Inducement Options, are issued under the Plan. The $20 Inducement Options and the $30 Inducement Options are granted outside of the Plan as “employment inducement grants” under New York Stock Exchange Listing Rule 303A.08 and were approved by the Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board.  Any bonus, equity or equity-based award or other incentive compensation granted to Mr. Duperreault will be subject to the AIG Clawback Policy (and any other AIG clawback policies as may be in effect from time to time). Mr. Duperreault will be entitled to severance in accordance with AIG’s Executive Severance Plan.  The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Letter Agreement and the related form of Stock Option award agreement, which are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, respectively, and which are incorporated by reference.  Transactions with Hamilton Insurance Group, Two Sigma Insurance Quantified and Attune Holdings  On May 14, 2017, AIG entered into a waiver agreement with Hamilton (the “Hamilton Waiver Agreement”) pursuant to which AIG will pay Hamilton $20 million in exchange for Hamilton’s release of Mr. Duperreault from restrictive covenants that would prevent or restrict Mr. Duperreault from being employed by AIG or serving on the Board. Pursuant to the Hamilton Waiver Agreement, AIG will make an additional payment of $20 million contingent upon the completion of Mr. Duperreault’s second year as Chief Executive Officer of AIG, which would continue to be payable in the event Mr. Duperreault is no longer employed as AIG’s Chief Executive Officer at such time due to his death or disability. In addition, Hamilton has advised AIG that, in connection with Mr. Duperreault’s appointment as AIG’s President and Chief Executive Officer effective May 14, 2017, Hamilton has cancelled or agreed to repurchase all of Mr. Duperreault’s equity and equity-related interests in Hamilton and its affiliates. As noted above, Mr. Duperreault was a founding member of Hamilton, served as Chief Executive Officer of Hamilton from 2013 to 2017 and as Chairman from 2016 to 2017 and, as of May 12, 2017 held shares and warrants representing approximately 1.6% of Hamilton’s outstanding common stock. In addition, Attune and certain affiliates of Hamilton and Two Sigma entered into a waiver and agreement (the “Attune Waiver Agreement”) waiving their respective rights to enforce certain employee non-solicitation restrictions relating to Attune, a joint venture in which affiliates of AIG, Hamilton and Two Sigma are equal parties. Attune was formed in September 2016 by affiliates of AIG, Hamilton and Two Sigma as a technology-enabled platform to serve the U.S. small to medium sized enterprise commercial insurance market. Affiliates of AIG made a $10 million capital contribution to Attune. In addition to having had an indirect ownership interest in Attune by virtue of his interests in Hamilton, Mr. Duperreault has served as Chairman of Attune since its formation in September 2016.  Also on May 14, 2017, AIG entered into a memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) with Hamilton and Two Sigma. The MOU provides that, subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions, AIG and Hamilton will enter into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which AIG will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hamilton U.S. Holdings, Inc. (“HUSA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hamilton, for a purchase price equal to HUSA’s book value at closing plus $30 million. HUSA’s book value plus the $30 million premium is currently estimated by Hamilton to total approximately $110 million. Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, AIG will deliver a deposit to Hamilton of $30 million within three business days after the Transition Date, which is non-refundable and will be applied towards the ultimate purchase price for the acquisition. Hamilton will retain its one-third ownership of Attune in the transaction. In addition, AIG will offer Hamilton the opportunity to participate in at least $150 million of reinsurance premium per year for six years (the “Reinsurance Strategic Partnership”), which minimum amount will increase by seven percent per year following the first year. If Hamilton elects to participate in AIG’s reinsurance panel, all pricing and other terms and conditions offered to Hamilton will be on arms’-length, market terms, and Hamilton’s involvement in AIG’s reinsurance panel will be subject to the requirements of AIG’s risk management framework.  The MOU also calls for AIG and Two Sigma to negotiate in good faith the terms of a development contract pursuant to which Two Sigma and AIG will develop a next generation insurance platform for AIG’s use. Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, AIG will deliver a non-refundable, good faith initial installment to Two Sigma of $37.5 million within three business days after the Transition Date, which amount will be used towards the development of the platform while the relationship is being finalized and will be applied towards the eventual compensation to be paid to Two Sigma under any definitive development contract ultimately agreed to. The ultimate cost for the development of the platform is currently estimated to be approximately $250 million over a five-year period.  On May 14, 2017, affiliates of AIG, Hamilton and Two Sigma agreed to expand the scope of Attune’s target market for small-to-medium enterprise businesses to include companies with annual revenues of up to $35 million.  AIG’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee approved the Hamilton Waiver Agreement, the Attune Waiver Agreement, the MOU, the Reinsurance Strategic Partnership and the expansion of the scope of Attune’s target market in accordance with AIG’s Related-Party Transactions Approval Policy.

1246,AIG,stay,2017-03-17 17:28:33,"March 15, 2017, the Compensation and Management Resources Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) adopted the AIG Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTI Plan”). The LTI Plan, which will be administered by the Committee, replaces the 2013 AIG Long Term Incentive Plan (the “Prior Plan”) for future awards. Consistent with the Prior Plan, the LTI Plan is intended to provide selected officers and key employees of AIG with incentives to contribute to the long-term performance of AIG in a manner that appropriately balances risk and rewards. The LTI Plan provides for grants of performance share units that are earned based on achievement of performance criteria during a three-year performance period and restricted stock units that are earned based on continued employment throughout the three-year performance period, unless the Committee determines a different period is appropriate for some or all participants. Earned performance share units may range from 0 to 200 percent of a participant’s target award based on achievement of the applicable performance metrics during the performance period. Participants may also receive dividend equivalent rights in the form of additional performance share units or restricted stock units, which will accrue commencing with the first dividend record date of AIG common stock following the grant date of the award and only be paid upon vesting. Earned awards under the LTI Plan will vest as specified in the applicable award agreement and be settled in shares of AIG common stock (or, at the election of AIG, cash equal to the fair market value thereof).  Awards and payments under the LTI Plan are subject to forfeiture and repayment to the extent provided in the AIG Clawback Policy, or any other such AIG clawback policy as in effect from time to time. All awards under the LTI Plan will be granted under, and will be subject to the terms and conditions of, the AIG 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, or any successor plan as approved by AIG’s shareholders. Copies of the LTI Plan and form of AIG Long Term Incentive Award Agreement are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.  March 15, 2017 Compensation Determinations  On March 15, 2017, the Committee determined that 2016 short-term incentive awards for members of AIG’s Executive Leadership Team (other than to Peter D. Hancock, President and Chief Executive Officer) were earned at 40% of each member’s individual target amount.  On March 15, 2017, the Committee also made regular 2017 grants under the LTI Plan to each member of AIG’s Executive Leadership Team (other than to Mr. Hancock). Grants were 70% in the form of performance share units and 30% in the form of restricted stock units, with both types of units vesting and being distributed at the end of the relevant three-year performance period and with performance share units continuing to be based on AIG’s relative total shareholder return and using relative option adjusted spread as a gating metric. For our continuing named executive officers, Mr. Sid Sankaran, Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Kevin Hogan, Executive Vice President – Consumer, grants were based on previously disclosed long-term incentive targets. The Committee also made one-time grants of restricted stock units under the LTI Plan to each member of AIG’s Executive Leadership Team (other than Mr. Hancock) designed to provide for continuity during this time of transition, including 93,414 restricted stock units to Mr. Sankaran, 108,983 restricted stock units to Mr. Doug Dachille, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, 101,198 restricted stock units to Mr. Hogan and 97,306 to Mr. Robert Schimek, Executive Vice President – Commercial.  The restricted stock units vest on the second anniversary of the grant date subject to the participant’s continued employment through such date (or earlier involuntary termination without cause).  Chief Executive Officer Arrangements  On March 17, 2017, upon the Committee’s recommendation, the Board approved a letter agreement between AIG and Mr. Hancock, in connection with Mr. Hancock’s previously announced transition. The letter agreement provides that Mr. Hancock will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer and director until a successor has been named or, if earlier, December 31, 2017 (the “Transition Period”). Upon his termination, Mr. Hancock will receive benefits consistent with a termination without cause under the AIG 2012 Executive Severance Plan as described in AIG’s 2016 Proxy Statement under the caption “Potential Payments on Termination.” In consideration of his service during the Transition Period, Mr. Hancock will be eligible to receive a cash payment of $5,000,000 for service through the Transition Period. He will also continue to receive his normal 2017 compensation. A copy of the letter agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.3 and is incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference. The foregoing summary regarding the letter agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.  On March 17, 2017, upon the Committee’s recommendation and after discussion with Mr. Hancock, the Board determined that Mr. Hancock would not earn a 2016 short-term incentive award and approved a 2017 grant under the LTI Plan to Mr. Hancock based on his previously disclosed long-term target, 50% in the form of performance share units and 50% in the form of restricted stock units and having the same terms as those made to other members of AIG’s Executive Leadership Team.

1262,AWK,down,2018-01-02 09:47:26,"December 11, 2017, the Company furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission a current report on Form 8-K and issued a press release that (i) included information regarding the Company’s GAAP and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the 2017 fiscal year; (ii) provided GAAP earnings per share and other financial and operational guidance for the 2018 fiscal year; and (iii) provided a projected range for its compound annual growth rate in earnings per share and other financial and operational guidance for the five-year period from 2018 to 2022 (collectively, the “Company Guidance”).  On December 22, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law what is commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), which, among other things, enacted significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry, most significantly allowing the continuation of certain interest expense deductibility and excluding 100% expensing of capital investments.  When issued, the Company Guidance did not, and it currently does not, take into account or reflect the changes in law set forth in the TCJA. On January 2, 2018, the Company issued a press release announcing that the enactment of the TCJA, and the adoption or issuance of any further rules, regulations, interpretations and guidance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury with respect thereto (collectively, the “Related Interpretations”), may materially impact the Company’s guidance and results of operations to be reported for fiscal 2017, and its expectations for future financial and operational performance contained in the Company Guidance, as well as the estimates, assumptions and sensitivities upon which the Company Guidance was based. The Company cannot currently estimate or quantify the impact of the enactment of the TCJA or any Related Interpretations, if and when issued, on the Company Guidance. The Company is required to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities, including its U.S. federal income tax net operating losses, at the new federal corporate income tax rate as of the date of enactment of the TCJA, or December 22, 2017. Most of the Company’s consolidated deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as a portion of its U.S. federal net operating losses, are held at the Company’s utility subsidiaries. The majority of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at the utility subsidiaries are subject to a normalization method of accounting pursuant to the Code and/or applicable public utility commission regulation. As a result, the revaluation of the utility subsidiaries’ net deferred taxes is expected to result in a regulatory liability that would be returned to utility customers over the remaining life of the related assets and liabilities and would not be expected to materially impact the Company’s results of operations under the normalization process.  The revaluation of deferred tax assets and U.S. federal net operating losses held at the parent company and other non-utility subsidiaries is expected to result in a potentially material charge to the Company’s results of operations for fiscal 2017. The Company will continue to assess the impact of the TCJA and any Related Interpretations, if and when issued, on the Company Guidance and the Company’s other forward-looking information, as well as the regulatory treatment of the TCJA in each of its 16 regulatory jurisdictions.  The Company expects to provide an estimate of the impacts of the TCJA in conjunction with the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and related disclosures, expected in February 2018. The information furnished in response to this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1 hereto, shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, nor shall it be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

1266,AWK,stay,2017-09-22 09:08:56,"September 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted preliminary approval of a settlement class and proposed class action settlement (the “Settlement”) with respect to claims against West Virginia-American Water Company (“WVAWC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of American Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company”), American Water Works Service Company, Inc. (“AWWSC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company (collectively, the “American Water Defendants”), by all putative class members (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) for all claims and potential claims arising out of the January 9, 2014 Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill into the Elk River in West Virginia. Preliminary approval was granted after the parties to the Settlement filed with the court a proposed amended settlement agreement and related materials on August 25, 2017 addressing the matters set forth in the court’s July 6, 2017 order denying without prejudice the joint motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement. The economic terms contained in the proposed amended settlement agreement are materially similar to those included in the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims originally approved by the court in October 2016 and previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the “2016 Form 10-K”), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 21, 2017. The terms of the Settlement propose a global resolution of all federal and state litigation and potential claims against the American Water Defendants and their insurers. Under federal class action rules, a claimant may elect to opt out of the final Settlement, in which case such claimant will not receive any benefit from or be bound by the terms of the Settlement. The American Water Defendants would have the right to withdraw from the Settlement if more than a certain number of putative class members opt out of the Settlement. Under the terms and conditions of the Settlement and the amended settlement agreement, the American Water Defendants have not admitted, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the Plaintiffs in any of the actions to be resolved. The proposed aggregate pre-tax amount of the Settlement with respect to the Company remains at $126 million. However, the aggregate portion of the Settlement to be contributed by WVAWC, net of insurance recoveries, has been reduced from $65 million to $43 million (approximately $26 million after-tax) due to the recent settlement with one of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers. This reduction will apply to WVAWC’s contributions to the guaranteed fund. The contribution by another defendant to the Settlement remains at $25 million. If any final approval order by the court with respect to the Settlement is appealed and such appeal would delay potential payment to claimants under the Settlement, WVAWC and the other defendant to the Settlement will contribute up to $50 million and $25 million, respectively, to the Settlement (not including, in the case of WVAWC, any contributions by the Company’s general liability insurance carriers which would not be made until such time as a final, non-appealable order is issued) into an escrow account during the pendency of such appeals. For certain claims, WVAWC and the other defendant to the Settlement may, in lieu of these escrowed contributions, make advance payments of such claims if agreed to by the parties. All administrative expenses of the Settlement and attorneys’ fees of class counsel related thereto would be paid from the funds designated to pay claims covered by the Settlement. Notice of the terms of the Settlement will be provided to members of the settlement class within 21 days of the court’s preliminary approval order. Following the notice period, the court will hold a fairness hearing to consider final approval of the Settlement. There can be no assurance that the Settlement will not be amended further or that the court will provide its final approval as to any agreement negotiated between the parties reflecting the terms of the Settlement.Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements included in this Current Report on Form 8-K are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

1267,AWK,stay,2017-09-19 17:22:02,"September 19, 2017, the Company and the insurance carrier settled this lawsuit for $22 million, out of a maximum of $25 million in potential coverage under the terms of the relevant policy, in exchange for a full release by the Company and WVAWC of all claims against the insurance carrier related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. This settlement with the insurance carrier reduced the total amount of WVAWC’s potential contributions to the Settlement from $65 million to $43 million. WVAWC will record an additional insurance receivable of $22 million, which the Company anticipates will result in an after-tax benefit of approximately $13 million in the third quarter of 2017.

Morgan Securities LLC, U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Notes have the benefit of a support agreement from American Water (the “Support Agreement”).   The Notes and the obligations of American Water represented by the Support Agreement were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-203949-01 and 333-203949).  At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion.  AWCC intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to lend funds to American Water and its regulated operating subsidiaries, and to (1) repay $524 million principal amount of AWCC’s 6.085% Senior Notes due 2017 upon maturity on October 15, 2017, (2) prepay approximately $138.4 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding 5.62% Series C Senior Notes due December 21, 2018 (the “Series C Notes”) and approximately $181.4 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding 5.77% Series D Senior Notes due December 21, 2021 (the “Series D Notes”, and, together with the Series C Notes, the “Series Notes”)), and (3) repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations, and for general corporate purposes.

The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated December 4, 2009, by and between AWCC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by officers’ certificates establishing the terms of the Notes.

As a result of AWCC’s prepayment of the Series Notes, American Water intends to record in the third quarter of 2017 a one-time debt extinguishment charge, which is currently estimated to be approximately $7 million and is largely associated with the portion of such debt allocable to American Water.

1280,AWK,stay,2016-10-31 17:21:04,"October 31, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia approved the preliminary principles, terms and conditions of an agreed-upon settlement (the “Settlement”) with respect to claims among West Virginia-American Water Company (“WVAWC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of American Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company”), American Water Works Service Company, Inc. (“AWWSC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company (collectively, the “American Water Defendants”), and all class members, putative class members, claimants and potential claimants (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”), arising out of the January 9, 2014 Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill into the Elk River in West Virginia. In August 2015, Freedom Industries and six former Freedom Industries employees (three of whom also were former owners of Freedom Industries), pled guilty to criminal violations of the federal Clean Water Act as a result of this chemical spill.  The terms of the Settlement propose a global federal and state resolution of all litigation and potential claims against the American Water Defendants and their insurers. A claimant may elect to opt out of any final settlement agreement, in which case such claimant will not receive any benefit from or be bound by the terms of the Settlement. Under the terms and conditions of the Settlement and any subsequent final settlement agreement, the American Water Defendants have not admitted, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the Plaintiffs in any of the actions to be resolved.  To date, there are 73 pending cases against WVAWC in federal and state courts with respect to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, including a consolidated class action originally filed against the American Water Defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia (the “Federal action”).  The Federal action includes classes comprised of residential and business customers of WVAWC’s Kanawha Valley Treatment Plant as of January 9, 2014. During September and October 2016, the court in the Federal action dismissed all claims against the Company and AWWSC, leaving WVAWC as the remaining American Water Defendant in the lawsuit. A trial in the Federal action solely on issues of fault was scheduled to begin on October 25, 2016, but the court in the Federal action delayed the start of the trial pending ongoing settlement discussions between the parties. Additionally, in January 2016, all of the then-filed state court cases were referred to West Virginia’s Mass Litigation Panel for further proceedings, and in June 2016, class action plaintiffs in the Mass Litigation Panel proceeding filed a second amended consolidated class action complaint naming only WVAWC as a defendant. The proposed aggregate pre-tax amount of the Settlement is $126 million, of which $65 million would be contributed by WVAWC, and the remainder would be contributed by certain of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers. The Company has general liability insurance under a series of policies underwritten by a number of individual carriers. Two of these insurance carriers, which provide an aggregate of $50 million in insurance coverage to the Company under these policies, were requested, but presently have not agreed, to participate in the Settlement. The Company and WVAWC will vigorously pursue their rights to insurance coverage from these non-participating carriers for any contributions by WVAWC to the Settlement. In this regard, WVAWC has filed a lawsuit against one of these carriers alleging that the carrier’s failure to agree to participate in the Settlement constitutes a breach of contract, and the Company is considering pursuing similar remedies against the other non-participating carrier. Despite these efforts, the Company may not ultimately be successful in obtaining full or further reimbursement under these insurance policies for amounts that WVAWC may be required to contribute to the Settlement. As a result of these events, WVAWC intends to record a charge to earnings, net of insurance receivables, of $65 million ($39 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2016. The Company intends to fund WVAWC’s contributions to the Settlement through existing sources of liquidity, although no contribution by WVAWC will be required unless and until the terms of the Settlement are finally approved by the court in the Federal action. Furthermore, under the terms of the Settlement, WVAWC has agreed that it will not seek rate recovery from the Public Service Commission of West Virginia for approximately $4 million in direct response costs expensed in 2014 by WVAWC relating to the chemical spill as well as for amounts paid by WVAWC under the Settlement. The Settlement intends to establish a two-tier settlement fund for the payment of claims, comprised of a guaranteed fund of $76 million and a claims-based payment fund of $50 million, to which funds WVAWC and the Company’s general liability insurance carriers will contribute.  An additional $25 million would be contributed to the guaranteed fund through a separate settlement by another defendant to the Settlement.      The court in the Federal action has given the parties 30 days to finalize, and obtain the court’s preliminary approval of, the terms of the Settlement. As a result, the court in the Federal action has ordered a continuance of the trial date to December 5, 2016. If preliminary approval of the Settlement is obtained, notice of the terms of the Settlement would then be provided to members of the settlement class. Following the notice period, the court in the Federal action would hold a fairness hearing to consider final approval of the Settlement. There can be no assurance that the court in the Federal action will provide its approval as to any agreement negotiated between the parties reflecting the terms of the Settlement.

Item 8.01.Other Events.   On March 29, 2016, Pennsylvania American Water entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with the SSA whereby Pennsylvania American Water is to acquire substantially all of the wastewater collection and treatment system assets of the SSA (the “System Assets”) for a total transaction value of approximately $195.0 million, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the “System Purchase”).  The SSA currently uses the System Assets to service approximately 31,000 wastewater customers in the City of Scranton and Dunmore Borough, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania American Water is seeking to close the System Purchase by September 30, 2016.  If the closing does not occur on or before October 15, 2016 (the “Termination Date”), either party may terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement so long as the terminating party is not in breach or default of its obligations thereunder. Each party has the right, subject to certain conditions, to extend the Termination Date to a date that is not later than December 31, 2016, and if any of the regulatory conditions specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement have not been satisfied as of the extended Termination Date, each party would have the right to extend the Termination Date again to a date that is not later than March 31, 2017. The Asset Purchase Agreement may also be terminated under specified conditions, including, without limitation, with respect to:  a material adverse effect (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) involving the SSA or its wastewater system; a condemnation or casualty involving the SSA’s real property or the System Assets; the inability of the SSA to comply with specified covenants with respect to title to properties and occupancy agreements; and the inability to obtain a required governmental approval or consent, or the conditioning of such a consent or approval in a manner that is deemed unacceptable to the parties. The SSA is currently subject to a Consent Decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“PaDEP”), which requires the SSA to complete significant upgrades to its sewer system at an estimated cost of $140 million.  As a part of the System Purchase, Pennsylvania American Water will be required to cause the Consent Decree to be amended to allow it to assume the obligations and liabilities of the SSA thereunder.  The closing of the System Purchase is subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and, with respect to the amendment of the Consent Decree, the consent of the EPA, PaDEP, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.

Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) estimates that the Tax Legislation will result in an unfavorable impact of $320 million in its fourth quarter earnings and will be an ongoing benefit to the Company’s earnings and cash flow generation.   ·                  The charge is primarily related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets using the lowered corporate tax rate, repatriation tax and lower future tax benefits from low income housing assets. This is a one-time, primarily non-cash, accounting adjustment.   ·                  The Company’s estimate is that the ongoing effective tax rate will be in the 17 to 19 percent range over the near term. The lower corporate tax rate will have an ongoing benefit to earnings and the Company expects to earn back the initial charge within two years.   The Company also expects fourth quarter 2017 results will include approximately $25 million after-tax net catastrophe losses from its auto and home insurance business, nearly all of which is attributable to California wildfires.

A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2013.   We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP performance measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities (“CIEs”), as well as certain integration/restructuring charges, the cessation of the deposit-taking and lending activities of Ameriprise National Trust Bank (formerly Ameriprise Bank, FSB), market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, market impact on indexed universal life benefits, realized gains (losses) and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2013 and 2012 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 also contain certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders’ equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, the net of assets and liabilities held for sale and the impact of consolidating the assets and liabilities of certain CIEs.  Management believes that these non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders’ equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure, and, in the case of adjustments related to former banking operations, these non-GAAP measures enable better comparability of year-over-year results. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.   Our non-GAAP financial measures included in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: adjusted net pretax operating margin; adjusted operating earnings; adjusted operating revenues; Ameriprise Financial shareholders’ equity excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders’ equity excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders’ equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; effective tax rate excluding noncontrolling interests; operating earnings; operating earnings per diluted share; operating effective tax rate; operating expenses; operating return on equity excluding AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax operating earnings; pretax operating margin; return on equity excluding AOCI; total Ameriprise Financial capital excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding fair value of hedges and unamortized discount; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount and equity of CIEs; and various financial measures that exclude the results of former banking operations.

A link to the conference call and slides prepared for the conference call are available under the Investors section of the Company's website at www.amerisourcebergen.com. Proceedings with the U.S Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New YorkAs previously disclosed, since fiscal 2012, the Company and its subsidiary AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (""ABSG"") have been responding to subpoenas from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York (""USAO-EDNY"") requesting production of documents and information relating to the pre-filled syringe program of ABSG’s subsidiary Medical Initiatives, Inc., ABSG's oncology distribution center, its group purchasing organization for oncologists, and intercompany transfers of certain oncology products. Medical Initiatives, Inc. voluntarily ceased operations in early 2014. The Company has produced documents and witnesses, and has engaged in ongoing dialogue with the USAO-EDNY, since 2012.ABSG recently reached an agreement in principle with the USAO-EDNY which the Company understands will resolve the government’s criminal investigation in its entirety. The agreement in principle is subject to negotiation of final terms, approval by the parties and execution of definitive documents, and the approval of the Court. Under the terms of the agreement in principle, ABSG will pay $260.0 million and plead guilty to a strict liability misdemeanor offense under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in connection with the failure of Medical Initiatives, Inc. to duly register with the United States Food and Drug Administration, and the Company will enter into a Compliance Agreement with the United States Department of Justice. In connection with the agreement in principle, the Company recorded a litigation reserve of $260.0 million in Employee Severance, Litigation, and Other on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017.The USAO-EDNY has also indicated that it intends to pursue alleged civil claims under the False Claims Act. Discussions with the USAO-EDNY to resolve such claims are ongoing, however there are significant disagreements between the parties and it remains unclear whether a settlement can be reached at this time or whether the matter will proceed to litigation. Should the matter proceed to litigation, the Company intends to vigorously defend itself. Any settlement or other resolution of this civil matter could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, and no conclusion can be drawn at this time as to any likely outcome in this matter.  Item 9.01.

All other terms of Warrant No. 2A and Warrant No. 2B remained the same.The foregoing description of the amendments does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Amendment No. 1 to Warrant No. 2A and Amendment No. 1 to Warrant No. 2B, which are filed as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.Warrant No. 2A and Warrant No. 2B, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Warrant No. 2A and Amendment No. 1 to Warrant No. 2B, respectively, are referred to in this Current Report on Form 8-K as the “Amended Warrants.”Item 3.02      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. The information contained above in Item 1.01 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02. The Amended Warrants, and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof, are subject to the terms of the Framework Agreement, dated as of March 18, 2013 (the “Framework Agreement”), between the Company, WBA (as successor in interest to Walgreen Co.) and Alliance Boots GmbH and the Shareholders Agreement, dated as of March 18, 2013 (the “Shareholders Agreement”), between the Company, WBA (as successor in interest to Walgreen Co.) and Alliance Boots GmbH.  The Framework Agreement and the Shareholders Agreement were filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 20, 2013. On August 25, 2016, WBA Holdings exercised in full the Amended Warrants.  Upon exercise, WBA Holdings paid $1,191,587,880 to the Company, and the Company issued 22,696,912 shares of Common Stock to WBA Holdings.The Company intends to use the proceeds from the exercise of the Amended Warrants: (i) to offset the dilution from the corresponding Common Stock issuance through previously announced methods, including the purchase of shares under issuer capped call option transactions and existing special share repurchase programs; (ii) to fund, in part, the repayment of the $600 million of 1.15% senior notes due May 2017 at the scheduled maturity; and (iii) for general corporate purposes. As previously disclosed, as a result of the Company's various warrant hedging activities, the Company does not expect any dilutive impact from the exercise of the Amended Warrants in fiscal 2016 or in fiscal 2017.Based on the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of August 23, 2016, after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise in full of the Amended Warrants, the Company would have had 237,891,501 shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date.The issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of the Amended Warrants has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

Certain of the statements contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Words such as “expect,” “would,” “intend,” variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change in circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on assumptions that could prove incorrect or could cause actual results to vary materially from those indicated. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied are the following: competition; industry consolidation of both customers and suppliers resulting in increasing pressure to reduce prices for our products and services; changes in pharmaceutical market growth rates; price inflation in branded and generic pharmaceuticals, and price deflation in generics; declining economic conditions in the United States and abroad; financial market volatility and disruption; substantial defaults in payment, material reduction in purchases by or the loss, bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer; the loss, bankruptcy or insolvency of a major supplier; changes to the customer or supplier mix; the retention of key customer or supplier relationships under less favorable economics or the adverse resolution of any contract or other dispute with customers or suppliers; changes to customer or supplier payment terms; changes in any of the economic models used by any of our suppliers to set pricing and/or other terms for the purchase of pharmaceuticals; interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; the disruption of AmerisourceBergen’s cash flow and ability to return value to its stockholders in accordance with its past practices; risks associated with the strategic, long-term relationship between Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen, including with respect to the pharmaceutical distribution agreement and/or the global sourcing arrangement;  risks associated with the potential impact on AmerisourceBergen’s earnings per share resulting from the issuance of the warrants to subsidiaries of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (the “Warrants”); AmerisourceBergen’s inability to fully implement its hedging strategy to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the issuance of its common stock in accordance with the Warrants under its special share repurchase program due to its financial performance, the current and future share price of its common stock, its expected cash flows, competing priorities for capital, and overall market conditions; changes in the United States healthcare and regulatory environment, including changes that could impact prescription drug reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid; increasing governmental regulations regarding the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding; federal and state government enforcement initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious orders of controlled substances and the diversion of controlled substances; federal and state prosecution of alleged violations of related laws and regulations, and any related litigation, including shareholder derivative lawsuits or other disputes relating to our distribution of controlled substances; increased federal scrutiny and qui tam litigation for alleged violations of fraud and abuse laws and regulations and/or any other laws and regulations governing the marketing, sale, purchase and/or dispensing of pharmaceutical products or services and any related litigation; material adverse resolution of pending legal proceedings; declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals; the acquisition of businesses that do not perform as expected, or that are difficult to integrate or control, including the integration of MWI and PharMEDium, or the inability to capture all of the anticipated synergies related thereto; managing foreign expansion, including non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-bribery laws and economic sanctions and import laws and regulations; malfunction, failure or breach of sophisticated information systems to operate as designed; risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data; changes in tax laws or legislative initiatives that could adversely affect AmerisourceBergen’s tax positions and/or AmerisourceBergen’s tax liabilities or adverse resolution of challenges to AmerisourceBergen’s tax positions; natural disasters or other unexpected events that affect AmerisourceBergen’s operations; the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, resulting in a charge to earnings; errors in the production, labeling or packaging of products compounded by our compounded sterile preparations (CSP) business; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors affecting AmerisourceBergen’s business generally. Certain additional factors that management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors), in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and elsewhere in that report and (ii) in other reports filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act.

Pursuant to the amended and restated bylaws the Company’s directors may be removed with or without cause.   The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amended and restated bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.   Proposal to Amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation   On January 22, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors recommended for stockholder approval an amendment that removes language in Section 5.05 of the Company’s certificate of incorporation providing that directors may be removed by the Company’s stockholders only for cause, so that members of the Board of Directors may be removed with or without cause.  On January 22, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors also directed that the recommended amendment to the certificate of incorporation be proposed for stockholder approval no later than the Company’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, the date of which has not yet been determined.

1360,ABC,stay,2015-11-24 16:05:24,"November 23, 2015, the Company received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service determining that the Company may recognize the tax consequences of the Warrants when they are exercised. As a result, the Company will be entitled to an income tax deduction when the Warrants are exercised for the Warrant expense equal to the difference between the fair value of the Warrants on the date of exercise and the strike price to be paid to exercise the Warrants. As a result of the receipt of the private letter ruling, in the quarter ending December 31, 2015, the Company will recognize in earnings a tax benefit adjustment of approximately $456 million representing the estimated tax deduction for the increase in the value of the Warrants since the inception of the arrangement through September 30, 2015. Additionally, the Company also expects to recognize the tax impact of the change in fair value of the Warrants, through the date of exercise, within the Company’s results of earnings subsequently at the applicable tax rate, currently estimated to be 36.5%.   The estimated $456 million tax benefit that the Company expects to record in the quarter ending December 31, 2015 will impact the Company’s GAAP earnings; however, it will not impact the Company’s previously announced expectations for fiscal year 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.73 to $5.90. The tax benefits are expected to eventually be beneficial to free cash flow, contingent upon the timing of the exercise of the Warrants and the stock price at the time of each exercise. The other key assumptions set forth in the Company’s news release dated October 29, 2015 and furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated the same date remain unchanged.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   Certain of the statements contained in this announcement are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Words such as “expect,” “likely,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “would,” “could,” “should,” “can,” “will,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “continue,” “sustain,” “synergy,” “on track,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “may,” “possible,” “assume,” variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change in circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on assumptions that could prove incorrect or could cause actual results to vary materially from those indicated. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied are the following: competition; industry consolidation of both customers and suppliers resulting in increasing pressure to reduce prices for our products and services; changes in pharmaceutical market growth rates; price inflation in branded and generic pharmaceuticals, and price deflation in generics; declining economic conditions in the United States and abroad; financial market volatility and disruption; substantial defaults in payment, material reduction in purchases by or the loss, bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer; the loss, bankruptcy or insolvency of a major supplier; changes to the customer or supplier mix; the retention of key customer or supplier relationships under less favorable economics or the adverse resolution of any contract or other dispute with customers or suppliers; interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; the disruption of AmerisourceBergen’s cash flow and ability to return value to its stockholders in accordance with its past practices; risks associated with the strategic, long-term relationship between Walgreen Boots Alliance, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen, including with respect to the pharmaceutical distribution agreement and/or the global sourcing arrangement; risks associated with the potential impact on AmerisourceBergen’s earnings per share resulting from the issuance of the warrants to subsidiaries of Walgreen Boots Alliance, Inc. (the “Warrants”); AmerisourceBergen’s inability to fully implement its hedging strategy to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the issuance of its common stock in accordance with the Warrants under its special share repurchase program due to its financial performance, the current and future share price of its common stock, its expected cash flows, competing priorities for capital, and overall market conditions; changes in the United States healthcare and regulatory environment; increasing governmental regulations regarding the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding; federal and state government enforcement initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious orders of controlled substances and the diversion of controlled substances; federal and state prosecution of alleged violations of related laws and regulations, and any related litigation, including shareholder derivative lawsuits or other disputes relating to our distribution of controlled substances; increased federal scrutiny and qui tam litigation for alleged violations of fraud and abuse laws and regulations and/or any other laws and regulations governing the marketing, sale, purchase and/or dispensing of pharmaceutical products or services and any related litigation; material adverse resolution of pending legal proceedings; declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals; the acquisition of businesses that do not perform as expected, or that are difficult to integrate or control, including the integration of MWI and PharMEDium, or the inability to capture all of the anticipated synergies related thereto; managing foreign expansion, including non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-bribery laws and economic sanctions and import laws and regulations; malfunction, failure or breach of sophisticated information systems to operate as designed; risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data; changes in tax laws or legislative initiatives that could adversely affect AmerisourceBergen’s tax positions and/or AmerisourceBergen’s tax liabilities or adverse resolution of challenges to AmerisourceBergen’s tax positions; natural disasters or other unexpected events that affect AmerisourceBergen’s operations; the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, resulting in a charge to earnings; errors in the production, labeling or packaging of products compounded by our compounded sterile preparations (CSP) business; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors affecting AmerisourceBergen’s business generally. Certain additional factors that management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors) and Item 1 (Business) in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and elsewhere in that report and (ii) in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The reader is cautioned not to rely unduly on these forward-looking statements. The Company expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.   2         SIGNATURES   "

The proxy access provision is included in Section 3.16 of the Amended and Restated Bylaws and will first be available for use with respect to the Company’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. The conforming changes regarding proxy access are included in Sections 2.03 and 2.09 of the Amended and Restated Bylaws.   The proxy access provision in the Amended and Restated Bylaws permits any stockholder who has or group of no more than 20 separate stockholders who have maintained continuous ownership of 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock for at least the previous three years to include in the Company’s proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders a number of director nominees up to the greater of two or 20% of the directors then in office (rounding down to the nearest whole number of directors if use of the 20% threshold does not result in a whole number), provided that the nominating stockholder(s) and the director nominee(s) satisfy all of the specified eligibility and other requirements in the proxy access provision in the Amended and Restated Bylaws.   The proxy access provision may only be used in connection with an annual meeting of stockholders. To use the proxy access provision, a stockholder must provide to the Company a notice of proxy access nomination and other important information, which must include certain representations and agreements by the stockholder, no earlier than 150 days and no later than 120 days before the first anniversary of the date the Company issued its definitive proxy statement for the prior year’s annual meeting of stockholders.  The required information includes, but is not limited to, stockholder statements verifying qualifying stock ownership as of the date of the notice of proxy access nomination and a copy of the stockholder’s Schedule 14N as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The required representations and agreements include, but are not limited to, the stockholder’s lack of intent to change or influence control at the Company and intent to maintain qualifying stock ownership through the date of the annual meeting. The Company may also require each stockholder nominee to provide any additional information that may be reasonably requested to determine if such nominee is independent or that may be reasonably required to determine the eligibility of such nominee to serve as a director of the Company.   The Amended and Restated Bylaws also make technical changes to Section 3.01 to reflect the 2014 completion of the phase out of the Company’s prior classified board structure. The Amended and Restated Bylaws also specify certain powers of the Company’s Lead Independent Director pursuant to Sections 3.07, 3.08 and 4.03, including the ability to call special meetings of the Board of Directors.

In its news release, the Company included certain non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“non-GAAP”) financial measures. The recurring adjustments made to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures included warrant expense, gains on antitrust litigation settlements, LIFO expense, acquisition-related intangibles amortization, and employee severance, litigation and other expenses. The Company also adjusted for a non-recurring impairment charge related to an equity investment to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures.  The adjustments made to diluted earnings per share relate to the accounting dilution resulting from the impact of the unexercised equity warrants, the impact from the shares repurchased under the Company’s special share repurchase programs and the related interest expense incurred in connection with the $600 million of 1.150% senior notes due in May 2017 issued by the Company solely in connection with the special share repurchase program.   Management considers GAAP financial measures as well as the presented non-GAAP financial measures in its evaluation of the Company’s operating performance.  Therefore, the Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP are attached to the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Participants in the Retirement and Savings Plan for Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (the “AML Retirement Plan,” and together with the 401(k) Plan, the “Plans”) may also elect to participate in the Offer, and if they do so elect, will also be subject to the Participant Restrictions.  If, as a consequence of the Participant Restrictions, 50% or more of the participants in the Plans are restricted in their ability to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer an interest in Shares for a period of more than three consecutive business days, a blackout period will arise under Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation BTR. During any blackout period, directors and executive officers of the Company will be prohibited from purchasing, selling, or otherwise acquiring or transferring, directly or indirectly, any equity security of the Company acquired in connection with their employment as an officer or services as a director.  It is currently unknown whether a blackout period will arise in connection with the Offer, because we cannot determine at this time whether 50% or more of participants in the Plans will make and not revoke an election to participate in the Offer. If a blackout period does arise because this 50% threshold is met, the blackout period could begin as soon as March 5, 2018, and could extend through March 8, 2018.

No. 11775-VCL, invalidating as a matter of law provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of VAALCO Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, that permitted the removal of VAALCO’s directors by its stockholders only for cause.  The Chancery Court held that, in the absence of a classified board or cumulative voting, VAALCO’s “only for-cause” director removal provisions conflict with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and are therefore invalid.   Clause 7 of Article SIXTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”) of Amphenol Corporation (the “Company”) contains a similar “only for-cause” director removal provision, and the Company does not have a classified board of directors or cumulative voting.  In light of the VAALCO decision, the Company will not attempt to enforce such “only for-cause” director removal provision.   On January 14, 2016, further as a result of the VAALCO decision, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions (the “Resolutions”) setting forth an amendment to the Company’s Charter (the “Proposed Amendment”) in order to provide that, consistent with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

The Restoration Plan is intended to restore certain benefits that cannot be provided under the Anadarko Employee Savings Plan (the “Savings Plan”) due to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code regarding participant and Company contributions that are applicable to the Savings Plan (the “IRC Limitations”). The benefit provided under the Restoration Plan is generally equal to the excess, if any, of the Company matching contributions and personal wealth account contributions (which personal wealth account contributions are in an amount equal to 4% of eligible compensation and apply only to individuals who participate in the personal wealth account portion of the Savings Plan) that would have been allocated to a participant’s account under the Savings Plan without regard to the IRC Limitations over the amounts that were, in fact, allocated to the participant’s account under the Savings Plan. Participants in the Restoration Plan include most of the Company’s officers as well as many other Company employees whose benefits under the Savings Plan are limited due to one or more of the IRC Limitations.  Prior to the amendment and restatement of the Restoration Plan that was adopted on October 30, 2017 (the “Restatement”), all amounts credited to a participant’s account under the Restoration Plan were fully vested at all times, except that the portion of such account attributable to the personal wealth account contributions made under the Savings Plan vested upon the participant’s completion of three years of vesting service under the Savings Plan. In order to simplify the administration of the Restoration Plan, the Restatement provides for full and immediate vesting at all times of a participant’s entire account under such plan, including the portion of such account attributable to the personal wealth account contributions made under the Savings Plan. Prior to the Restatement, Mitchell W. Ingram was the only named executive officer who had an unvested account credit under the Restoration Plan attributable to personal wealth account contributions. Accordingly, as a result of the Restatement, Mr. Ingram became fully vested in such portion of his account under the Restoration Plan effective as of January 1, 2017 rather than on November 1, 2018, which is the date he would have completed three years of vesting service under the Savings Plan.     2       SIGNATURES  "

The shares to be delivered under the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan may be made available from any combination of shares held in the Company’s treasury or authorized but unissued shares of the Company’s common stock. The Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan will be administered by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) with respect to all participants who are subject to the requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Section 16 Insiders”), or with respect to individuals who are reasonably deemed to be a “Covered Employee” as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code. With respect to participants other than Section 16 Insiders or Covered Employees, the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan may be administered by the Management Committee, which is comprised of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (so long as that officer is a member of the Board) and such other members of the Board as may be appointed to the Management Committee by the Board from time to time. The applicable plan administrator is responsible for administering the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan and has the discretionary power to interpret the terms and intent of the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan and any related documentation, to determine eligibility for awards and the terms and conditions of awards, to adopt rules, regulations, forms, instruments and guidelines and to exercise such powers and perform such acts as are deemed necessary or advisable to promote the best interests of the Company with respect to the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan. The Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan provides for awards of stock options (which may be designed to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code, or they may be designed as nonstatutory stock options), stock appreciation rights (either in tandem with a stock option award or as a stand-alone award), restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards (which may be in the form of performance shares or performance units), incentive awards, cash awards or “other” stock-based awards (which may include the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted shares of the Company’s common stock and awards or shares of the Company’s common stock in lieu of obligations to pay cash or deliver other property or common stock to an individual). The Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan imposes annual per-participant award limits and all awards under the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan are subject to the terms, conditions and limitations as determined by the applicable plan administrator. Awards that are intended to meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code (other than stock options and stock appreciation rights) will be designed using certain predetermined performance goals which were approved by the Company’s stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting. These performance goals are listed within the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan document attached hereto. Unless otherwise provided in a participant’s award or other agreement, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan) of the Company and the termination of the participant’s employment or service without cause or for good reason (as defined in the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan) during the protection period applicable to the participant, any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right will become fully exercisable, and any outstanding performance share, performance unit, restricted stock, restricted stock unit, other stock-based award or other cash award that was forfeitable will become non-forfeitable and fully vest, and to the extent applicable, will be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock or cash; provided, however, that any performance-based awards will vest only to the extent the underlying performance goals are satisfied, with the amount of vesting based on actual performance. Unless provided otherwise in an award agreement, all other stock-based awards held by a non-employee member of the Board will generally be paid to the participant within thirty days after the date of a change of control, except that no such awards will be paid to the participant if he or she continues to serve as a member of the Board or upon the board of directors of the Company’s successor, until such time such awards would otherwise be paid. Each participant’s award shall be conditioned on repayment or forfeiture in accordance with any Company policy, applicable law, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and/or the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and any relevant provisions in the related award agreement. The Compensation Committee may amend the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan as it may deem proper and in the best interests of the Company, provided however that to the extent the amendment is required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule to be submitted for stockholder approval, the approval of the Board will also be obtained. No change can be made to any award granted under the Amended 2012 Omnibus Plan without the consent of the participant if such change would impair the right of the participant under the provisions of the award to acquire or retain common stock or cash that the participant may have otherwise acquired.
